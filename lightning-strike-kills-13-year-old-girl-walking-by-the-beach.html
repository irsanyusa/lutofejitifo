According to media reports, the girl was walking along the beach with her mother when she was <a href=# id=b216fc10-72de-40b3-af44-cc29b8748352 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>struck by lightning</a> around 3 pm. Torrential rain had been falling in the region since morning.</p><p>"We were at the beach with the whole family. We got out of the sea when it was drizzling. The lightning struck directly in front of us," the teenager's father told the media. The man reported that the family got out of the sea to take shelter from the approaching storm.</p><p>"My wife was walking in front, my daughter was behind her. They both fell on the sand (...) We came out of the sea. Lightning struck, and my child never rose again," he added.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The 13-year-old was taken to a health centre, but her life could not be saved. The family comes from the nearby town of Nea Moudania.</p><p>Deaths from lightning are rare in Greece. Special care should be taken during storms.</p><p>According to scientists from the University of Patras, between 2010 and 2019, 23 people died in Greece due to lightning strikes. In 2020, a woman died while working on a farm during a storm, and in 2023, lightning fatally struck a 26-year-old British man who was swimming in the sea off the coast of Rhodes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXyttcahq6ehnpx6tMDRoqKeZZueua2%2FjGpqZrGVlr9uu8udZKChoqF6uK3LpKCnn12Xxm7Ax55km52RmLVwgMasb69xYA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
