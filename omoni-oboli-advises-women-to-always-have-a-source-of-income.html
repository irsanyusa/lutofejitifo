Always remember that I love you and God loves you too #Omoney."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Her post garnered reactions from Instagram users, who took to her comment section to voice their opinions on the matter.</p><p>One user expressed passionately, "We ladies shouldn't even be reminded to get something doing for ourselves. We are human beings first before we become wives or partners for men. Does it mean we were just created without any purpose for ourselves and must only wait on a man? I just don't get the mentality of some ladies."</p><p>"Facts. Personal income gives some level of independence," said another user in agreement</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c39725f9-d523-4487-924b-9518594d3bd8 data-caption="Comments from Omoni Oboli's post [Instagram/Omoni Oboli]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/dy7ktkpTURBXy9lYjU0OWI3OWE2OWFiNDE3NDRkY2M0MmNkOGY5MjhlYi5wbmeRlQLNAuDNAcnCww></span> <span class=caption>Comments from Omoni Oboli's post [Instagram/Omoni Oboli]</span> <span class=copyright>Pulse Nigeria</span><p>Some users shed light on the issue from a different perspective. A male user wrote, "This world is too hard now for a man yo. God wasn’t wrong when he made it clear in the bible when he pointed out women as helpers. This isn’t to forget that we men MUST be the sole provider in any relationship, no matter how. The income of the man is what the household depends on, even if the wife is making more."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Others concurred, highlighting the importance of personal income as a means of gaining independence and self-worth</p><p>"So that, if your man leaves you, your pain won’t be based on the fact that you won’t be getting money from him anymore," said another user.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaopZ%2Bjtm67waijomWRmcOqv8SsZLCnnZq7bsDOZpilr5GuwG60wK%2BcZpldqLy2vsKeZKieXZ67pLvMnmampKRnr6uw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
