As we witness her graceful attempt to dance all the way to the finale, here are some facts to get to know her more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-surprised-everyone-with-dwts-announcement>She Surprised Everyone with DWTS Announcement</h2><p>When Jessie announced that she will hit the ballroom as celebrity in Dancing With The Stars Season 31, her fans are almost dumbfounded. Literally, no one saw this announcement coming. Nonetheless, that did not stop the fans to root for her in the dancing competition.</p><p>As seen in the DWTS premiere, Jessie is paired with Alan Bersten who previously won the mirrorball Season 28 (2019). This new addition to DWTS family plans to stay in the show until she can and looks forward in securing the Mirrorball trophy.</p><p>Apparently, she juggles her practice for the dancing competition with touring. She once shared on Instagram that she and Alan rehearsed in the parking lot of her concert venue.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jessie James Decker Before Dancing With The Stars?</h2><p>Before she added dancing in her extensive list of skill set, Jessie was a country singer and reality television personality. She kicked off her music career in Nashville, Tennessee, auditioning for country labels within her locality. Having rejected multiple times, she began working with her mentor, Carla Wallace of Big Yellow Dog Music to enhance her sound. Eventually, Jessie sealed a contract with Mercury Records.</p><p>In 2009, she released her first ever album, Jessie James. From there, she continued to compose music and issue albums and extended plays. Southern Girl City Lights was perhaps her best creation, debuting No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart.</p><p>Apart from music, Jessie also made her television appearance through Eric & Jessie: Game On with her husband, Eric Decker. Airing for three seasons, the public was able to know Jessie on an intimate level, seeing her deal with fame, family, and football. That said, being casted in DWTS Season 31 is a milestone because Eric & Jessie: Game On was the last time she appeared on TV.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jessie Owns a Swim Collection Under Her Brand Kittenish</h2><p>Last July, Jessie rocked the Miami Swim Week when she walked in the runway in a neon pink bikini. The DWTS celebrity has recently launched a vibrant swimwear collection. She introduced this line to make a woman feel “playful and sporty or low-key when hitting the beach or relaxing poolside.”</p><p>Jessie opened up online about her battle against anxiety and depression. Her swimsuit line is thus a step forward in countering her <a href=#>body image issues </a>and braving through her vulnerabilities.</p><p>In the next episodes of Dancing With The Stars Season 31, Jessie James Decker is expected to up her game even more. Certainly, her fans are ready to give their all-out support for her, maximizing the 10 allowable votes each person.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Original_BestDanceGroups_TalentRecap.jpg alt="The Best Dance Groups In ‘AGT’ History" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>DWTS</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYrG4wNJmmp6klZe%2FqsDYZqGeq6Oesm62wKacrGWUmrCssdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
