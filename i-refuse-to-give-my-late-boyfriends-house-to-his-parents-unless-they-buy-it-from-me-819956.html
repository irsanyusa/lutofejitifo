He&nbsp;saved enough to&nbsp;purchase a&nbsp;house 10&nbsp;years ago and was paying the mortgage by&nbsp;himself. Four years ago, he&nbsp;was diagnosed with cancer. He&nbsp;reduced his working hours to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;his health, and&nbsp;I stepped in&nbsp;to&nbsp;pay the mortgage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/819/1f0/01ee6a5c08a3c27b1dc5f2f70a.png><p>He&nbsp;went on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explaining</a>:</p><p>“It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;hard battle, but cancer took him in&nbsp;March. After he&nbsp;died, his family suddenly reappeared, expressing regret for not being in&nbsp;his life. As&nbsp;time passed, a&nbsp;month ago, they reached out to&nbsp;me&nbsp;asking when they could expect me&nbsp;to&nbsp;hand over the keys to&nbsp;the house.</p><p>I&nbsp;told them they can’t have the house, because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now in&nbsp;my&nbsp;name. I&nbsp;bought the house from my&nbsp;boyfriend a&nbsp;year after his cancer diagnosis, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;legally mine, and&nbsp;I had been paying the mortgage long before that. They got upset and said&nbsp;I was being unreasonable, arguing that it&nbsp;should legally belong to&nbsp;them, and that my&nbsp;boyfriend would have wanted them to&nbsp;have the house.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/448/5e6/38b26352faad72e9660f17fd43.png><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>:</p><p>“After some thought, I&nbsp;told them, ’You can only have the house under one condition: you would have to ’buy’ it&nbsp;from me&nbsp;by&nbsp;reimbursing me&nbsp;for the four years of&nbsp;mortgage payments and take on&nbsp;the remaining debt.’ They said they didn’t have the money and accused me&nbsp;of&nbsp;being selfish. They proposed transferring the debt to&nbsp;their name without compensating&nbsp;me, but I&nbsp;declined. They got angry, and the discussion escalated to&nbsp;the point where they threatened to&nbsp;take me&nbsp;to&nbsp;court, accusing me&nbsp;of&nbsp;scamming my&nbsp;boyfriend to&nbsp;get the house.</p><p>They have been calling and texting me&nbsp;non-stop for the past month, threatening&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;know they can’t afford to&nbsp;pay me&nbsp;back for all the money I’ve invested in&nbsp;the house, but I’m conflicted. Some friends have advised me&nbsp;to&nbsp;give them the house and move on&nbsp;with my&nbsp;life, but it&nbsp;just doesn’t feel right to&nbsp;me. I’m leaning towards not giving them the house. I&nbsp;don’t need&nbsp;it, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, but&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;them either. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong for refusing to&nbsp;hand over the house?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/da1/9d9/80b541559a8bc633b1bee7caf1.png><p><h2>Other Redditors chimed in&nbsp;to&nbsp;support him, leaving comments such&nbsp;as:</h2></p><ul><li>Call the cops and say you’re being harassed, because you are! You offered a&nbsp;very reasonable solution, they declined. Your husband wanted you to&nbsp;have the home, which is&nbsp;why it’s in&nbsp;your name! Don’t let them cash in&nbsp;on&nbsp;it.<br>They didn’t care about him when he&nbsp;was alive, they don’t get his house! For context, I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;no&nbsp;contact with my&nbsp;mother and siblings about 2&nbsp;years ago. They have known all&nbsp;I needed was an&nbsp;apology and&nbsp;I would let them back into my&nbsp;life.<br>I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;pissed if&nbsp;they tried this after&nbsp;I had passed, but didn’t try to&nbsp;make amends during my&nbsp;life. It&nbsp;adds insult onto injury. I&nbsp;would NOT want them to&nbsp;have my&nbsp;home. I&nbsp;would want it&nbsp;with someone who loved me&nbsp;unconditionally.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;I_l0v3_d0gs&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>If&nbsp;you give them the house now, then they benefit from him, even though they rejected him when alive. You keep the house, because you’re the one who loved your boyfriend.

Don’t get into any further conversation with your boyfriend’s parents. Just ignore them. If&nbsp;they think they are entitled to&nbsp;what is&nbsp;your house and your home, let them take legal action. If&nbsp;they can’t afford this that is&nbsp;their problem not yours.<br>Leave any texts you get from them as&nbsp;unread.

Do&nbsp;not let them convince you of&nbsp;something you do&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;do. You owe them nothing.<br>Your partner sold you the house, knowing how ill he&nbsp;was. He&nbsp;wanted you to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;stable place to&nbsp;live. He&nbsp;would not want you to&nbsp;give them the house you shared as&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;relationship with you but not his family. It&nbsp;will not honor your spouse to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;what he&nbsp;made sure you would have, especially since they only want to&nbsp;claim property after his death, but made no&nbsp;claim to&nbsp;him while he&nbsp;was alive.<br>Keep your home. They are not family to&nbsp;you or&nbsp;to&nbsp;him.

It&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;respectful to&nbsp;his memory to&nbsp;give them the house when they never showed an&nbsp;ounce of&nbsp;regret in&nbsp;his lifetime. Also, the actions of&nbsp;your late boyfriend show that he&nbsp;cared about looking out for you.
