Well, Taylors mom Andrea decided to share the video with Jimmy Fallon, who played it for the entire world while Taylor was on his show this week.</p><p>Your mom may or may not have videotaped you after surgery and she gave us the video! Jimmy told Taylor. And then he played it. For everyone.</p><p>In the video, Taylor can be seen in her kitchen, wearing a pair of protective goggles that were taped to her head. She picks up a banana to eat it, and then gets super upset when she realizes she grabbed the wrong one. That wasnt the one I wanted! she whined to her mom.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Taylor looked like she was going to cry and her mom stepped in. Stop, you cant cry! Thats not supposed to be what youre doing! I tried to get this one, Taylor said, as she sniffled. What do we do with this one now?</p><p>Ill eat it, its fine, Andrea said. Taylor, still totally upset, said that the banana was already pulled form the bunch and now doesnt have a head.</p><p>Andrea gets Taylor into bed and then warns her to be careful while eating. Dont fall asleep eating the banana, Andrea said. Taylors response: Im not asleep, my mind is alive.</p><p>You can watch the video in all its glory here:</p><p>In case youre not familiar with it, LASIK eye surgery is a popular surgical procedure thats done on your eyes to improve your vision, according to the <a href=# id=3e995f1f-8b0f-3dea-a705-7a774a32e2e9>National Eye Institute</a> (NEI). During the surgery, a laser is used to permanently change the shape of your cornea (the clear front part of your eye). After having surgery, a person will hopefully be able to stop wearing glasses or contacts, or to at least use them less.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Hilarious video aside, Taylor seems happy with the results. I really can see very well, she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrrGWdpLpuv8eaqZ6cXZZ6t7XDnqZmp5ZiwamxjKygp5%2BVp3qistOeqWakkai2rHnEspxmq6WntKa%2B2GauoqyYYrequcyyZqqqqmq6ecM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
