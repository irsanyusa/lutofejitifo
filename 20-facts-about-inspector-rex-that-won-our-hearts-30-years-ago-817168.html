The audience watched the adventures of&nbsp;the police officer and his <a href=# title=dog data-link=tag>dog</a> with bated breath. They cried with emotion when the heroes came to&nbsp;each other’s rescue in&nbsp;dangerous situations, and laughed when they couldn’t share a&nbsp;hot dog. Our favorite&nbsp;TV show has turned 30&nbsp;so we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;tell you some interesting facts about&nbsp;<a href=# title=it data-link=tag>it</a>.</p><ul><li>The idea to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;detective series starring a&nbsp;smart dog <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>belongs</a> to&nbsp;the Austrian filmmakers, Peter Hajek and Peter Moser. Hajek <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “I&nbsp;really love animals. And it&nbsp;was cool to&nbsp;work with a&nbsp;dog and to&nbsp;learn a&nbsp;lot about these animals just by&nbsp;watching him.”</li><li>He&nbsp;also added, “I’ll be&nbsp;honest: I&nbsp;enjoyed writing a&nbsp;script about a&nbsp;dog more than&nbsp;I enjoyed writing a&nbsp;script about people. And anyone who says&nbsp;I was looking for fame is&nbsp;lying. I&nbsp;was just doing what&nbsp;I was passionate about.”</li></ul><p>The cast with the series creator</p><ul><li>So, the dog’s partner became Tobias Moretti, the actor of&nbsp;Austrian-Italian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>origin</a>, who got the role of&nbsp;Inspector Richard Moser. By&nbsp;the way, this character is&nbsp;the namesake of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the creators of&nbsp;the series for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reason</a>: he&nbsp;was named after Peter Moser.</li><li>40&nbsp;<a href=# title=German data-link=tag>German</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Shepherd</a> dogs were tested for the role of&nbsp;Rex until the dog with the amazing name, Santo vom Haus Zieglmayer, was selected. His owner <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> the German dog breeder, Helmut Brossmann. And Rex’s body double was his own brother.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ae/06f/3d1096536587e820f3ba9e6ed9.jpg><p>picture-alliance / dpa / EAST NEWS</p><p>Otti v&nbsp;Haus Zieglmayer is&nbsp;the mother of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> dog who played Rex.</p><ul><li>But even though the star of&nbsp;the show was found, the dog still needed time to&nbsp;be&nbsp;trained properly. And the training took 5&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>months</a>. Herr Santo vom Haus Zieglmayer diligently trained up&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;hours daily. He&nbsp;was taught commands in&nbsp;both <a href=# title=English data-link=tag>English</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>German</a>.</li><li>Santo’s trainer was Teresa Ann Miller, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a> of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> trainer Karl Miller, who trained dogs for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movies</a> <i>Beethoven</i>, <i>Cujo</i>, and many others.</li><li>This is&nbsp;what Teresa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> about her work on&nbsp;<i>Inspector Rex,</i> “The most interesting thing to&nbsp;me&nbsp;was the challenge. There’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things that the dog is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;doing in&nbsp;the show that I’ve never had an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;do&nbsp;myself. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;train the dog in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that he&nbsp;enjoyed the process. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;understood what was required of&nbsp;him, I&nbsp;would end the session to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;positive. I&nbsp;didn’t want him to&nbsp;get bored with our sessions and stop seeing them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fun game.”</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b49/410/cba8215c39a46d8f2da2bad0f2.jpg><ul><li>Probably everyone remembers the opening scene of&nbsp;the show, where Rex spectacularly breaks a&nbsp;window. Of&nbsp;course, real glass wasn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> during the <a href=# title=filming data-link=tag>filming</a>, so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;harm the dog. But it’s really interesting how the trainer taught him this trick.</li><li>Teresa first got Rex to&nbsp;jump through an&nbsp;empty wooden frame. The frame was then gradually covered with a&nbsp;plastic sheet which had a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the middle. This helped Rex to&nbsp;jump through whilst getting used to&nbsp;certain pressure against his back. Rex repeated the jump until the hole in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the frame was so&nbsp;small that the plastic sheet tore. Finally, “sugar” glass replaced the plastic sheet, thus giving the effect of&nbsp;real glass.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b6/d0a/e5a0215977a7a14645c763ee93.jpg><ul><li>The first season of&nbsp;the show was released in&nbsp;1994 and immediately won the hearts of&nbsp;the audience. In&nbsp;Germany alone, the show was watched by&nbsp;about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>10&nbsp;million</a> viewers. And although most characters spoke Austrian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dialects</a>, many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>countries</a> bought the rights to&nbsp;broadcast the series and translated&nbsp;it.</li><li><a href=# title=Europe data-link=tag>Europe</a> was swept by&nbsp;“Rexomania.” In&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Netherlands data-link=tag>Netherlands</a>, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> to&nbsp;produce bubble gum which had inserts featuring Rex, in&nbsp;Italy, you could find albums for collecting Rex stickers, and in&nbsp;Germany, different merchandise was sold: calendars, postcards, books and even CDs with the sound of&nbsp;the famous dog barking.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8d/91a/073ae2534dbb393c94587af42b.jpg><ul><li>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the early seasons, you can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>see</a> the now-Hollywood superstar, Christoph Waltz. He&nbsp;portrayed a&nbsp;doll shop owner who leads a&nbsp;double life. Later in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, the actor was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> what it&nbsp;was like to&nbsp;transition from an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;historical drama <i>Catherine The Great </i>to&nbsp;a&nbsp;small part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;series starring a&nbsp;dog. And he&nbsp;answered that he&nbsp;was fine with&nbsp;it.</li><li>In&nbsp;almost every episode, the cops ate hot dogs, and were unable to&nbsp;share them. And Rex was always trying to&nbsp;steal it&nbsp;from someone. Wolf Bachofner, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>played</a> the role of&nbsp;Moser’s partner, later revealed that although he&nbsp;enjoyed eating hot dogs in&nbsp;the series, in&nbsp;reality he&nbsp;couldn’t stand this food for 5&nbsp;years after the filming.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e36/ee6/1e9fbd5f759f5e8ecfe8409425.jpg><ul><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1998</a>. The show is&nbsp;watched, the show is&nbsp;loved. Suddenly, Tobias Moretti announces that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;leaving the show. The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> the writers to&nbsp;kill his character.</li><li>Tobias <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “To&nbsp;dedicate 4&nbsp;years of&nbsp;your life to&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog, even if&nbsp;it’s as&nbsp;smart as&nbsp;Rex, is, you know, overkill. My&nbsp;girlfriend had to&nbsp;constantly clean the apartment from the dog hair&nbsp;I brought in&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;clothes from work. I’m surprised she agreed to&nbsp;marry me&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. But it&nbsp;was important to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that my&nbsp;character’s line came to&nbsp;a&nbsp;smooth conclusion.”</li><li>It&nbsp;also later emerged that Moretti hated when the dog <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>licked</a> his face. And this happened at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;almost every episode, when Moser and Rex rejoiced at&nbsp;the successful capture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;villain.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c92/3d8/f0092657719198b6854959b5af.jpg><ul><li>Anyway, the creators respected the actor’s decision and granted his request: they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filmed</a> a&nbsp;2-hour finale for Moser. Needless to&nbsp;say, the tragic fate of&nbsp;the screen policeman literally broke the audience’s hearts.</li><li>Trainer Teresa Ann Miller later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that the episode with Moser’s death was one of&nbsp;the most important in&nbsp;her career. According to&nbsp;Teresa, her student, when portraying despair and grief, performed as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;Robert De&nbsp;Niro.</li><li>Moretti’s departure made many people upset, but, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;all know, the show must go&nbsp;on. So, Rex needed another partner. And this partner became the actor of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>German</a> descent Gedeon Burkhard, who bypassed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>25</a>&nbsp;competitors and landed the role of&nbsp;police officer Alexander Brandtner. Some attentive viewers even noticed that he&nbsp;had already appeared in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the early <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>episodes</a> of&nbsp;the series, where he&nbsp;played a&nbsp;criminal.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/008/649/2d424751a39d7c657cea7e38e6.jpg><ul><li>It’s funny that this actor once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that he’d never film soap operas. But when he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;work with a&nbsp;famous dog, he&nbsp;didn’t miss&nbsp;it. For the sake of&nbsp;this project, the actor even moved from <a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a> to&nbsp;Vienna with his girlfriend.</li><li>Gedeon Burkhard was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delighted</a> with his four-legged colleague, “Rex is&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional actor and extraordinary colleague. He&nbsp;knows exactly when is&nbsp;rehearsal and when is&nbsp;shooting. In&nbsp;rehearsal, he&nbsp;does only half, but when the camera starts shooting he&nbsp;does his best and gives maximum. Rex needs half less shots than&nbsp;me!” The actor adored his work so&nbsp;much that even put a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sticker</a> <i>Inspector Rex</i> on&nbsp;his car.</li><li>In&nbsp;1999, Santo von Haus Zigelmeyer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>retired</a>, and the starring role was succeeded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;German Shepard dog named Rhett Butler. After finishing his acting career, Santo <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stayed</a> with his trainer, who took him to&nbsp;her home in&nbsp;Hollywood.</li><li>The creators of&nbsp;the series partially changed Rex’s character as&nbsp;well. For example, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stopped</a> being jealous of&nbsp;his partner to&nbsp;women. With Richard Moser, the dog tried to&nbsp;spoil all his potential romantic relationships. But with Alexander Brandtner, he&nbsp;on&nbsp;the contrary tried to&nbsp;help in&nbsp;any way, and even brought a&nbsp;rose in&nbsp;his teeth for his love interest.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/976/0b3/17fa6d53a794e667a4bb56de49.jpg><ul><li>Gedeon Burkhard wasn’t very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>popular</a> in&nbsp;Austria and Germany, as&nbsp;ratings showed. But internationally, Burkhard became even more popular than Moser, especially, in&nbsp;Italy. Also, the&nbsp;US and <a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a> got interested in&nbsp;the series.</li><li>Anyway, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>left</a> the project in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2001</a> when his contract expired. It&nbsp;was rumored that he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;leave the show even earlier because of&nbsp;the harsh criticism from German and Austrian viewers.</li><li>So, the policeman Alex Brandtner suffered the same fate as&nbsp;Richard Moser, he&nbsp;died in&nbsp;the line of&nbsp;duty. However, the episode with his death was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>broadcast</a> only in&nbsp;Germany. This is&nbsp;why <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>people</a> from other countries couldn’t understand why Rex got a&nbsp;new partner, Marc Hoffmann.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/PNG/3cd/67b/6d422d507cb7cab1af99161c06.PNG><ul><li>Rex’s new partner did not impress the audience much. And although the actor Alexander Pschill also got a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fans, most of&nbsp;the audience were indignant. They didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>like</a> the fact that Marc’s romantic relationship seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more important than Rex’s work.</li><li>In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2004</a>, the Austrian production of&nbsp;the series was completed. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;noteworthy that the project “outlived” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Santo</a>, the first dog who portrayed Rex, for only a&nbsp;year. Everyone’s favorite went over the rainbow bridge in&nbsp;2003, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;12.</li><li>In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2008</a>, it&nbsp;was decided to&nbsp;relaunch the show in&nbsp;Italy under the same name. But that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;different story.</li></ul><p>And if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;dive into nostalgia and remember other&nbsp;TV shows of&nbsp;your childhood, then here is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting <a href=#>article</a> about <i>Charmed</i> TV&nbsp;show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xecWamq2rXZavsMHTZqCnq6CasLW70WapnrBdqbWiwIywpqdln6q%2FbrTEmqmtq11ofW7FxJqprGWRnLxuhJBwaG9wXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
