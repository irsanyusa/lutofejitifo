It is currently unclear how they were killed.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>One 87-year-old woman was resuscitated by emergency services but later died in hospital. In one case, the man is alleged to have killed a 76-year-old woman in her flat in the Berlin district of Neukölln. He then failed to set fire to her apartment, before informing her relatives that he could not get in as she was not answering the doorbell.</p><p>The man is not the only doctor to have been detained in Berlin in recent months. In April, a former cardiologist at Berlin’s Charité hospital was convicted of killing two seriously ill patients with lethal overdoses in 2021 and 2022, according to the Berlin Regional Court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXyjsdGloKdllKSwtbvRZpuerJGeu6awjJ%2Bmq2Wbnrmttc2gZG1llaGxpr7LsmSfnZ2WuaZ5z5qrop2eqcButc1mq6Gdmad6qbvMnqpooJtnsHh8ww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
