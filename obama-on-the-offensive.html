In my native land, the pessimists said Corazon Aquino and her lack of experience didn’t stand a chance against President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. History proved them wrong. A unifying figure like Aquino, without the usual political baggage that accompanies experience, was what the Philippines needed at the time. Obama presents himself as a conciliatory figure whose crossover appeal can help bridge the gap between blue and red staters. He is a much needed breath of fresh air in the musty corridors of power. As John F. Kennedy said, it is time for the torch to be passed on to a new generation. Let Obama be that torchbearer. He will put this nation back on the right track and make us proud to be citizens of the world once again.<br>Cheers Echevarria-Leary, PINOLE, CALIF., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like me, my eightysomething mother, a politically savvy liberal who has loved Oprah Winfrey for years, is deeply disappointed by Winfrey’s support for Obama. Yes, we have to consider that there are men who will vote for anyone but a woman, and especially anyone but Hillary Clinton. But for “O” to support Obama, who’s vastly less experienced than Clinton, makes Oprah’s decision seem divisive, racist and against the best interests of the country as a whole. This next presidential vote cannot be about color or sex. It’s got to be about qualifications. Her choice is an example of reverse racism, a subject white people feel too guilty to discuss.<br>Susan Mather, SAN FRANCISCO</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I would like to see an article that omits the candidates’ faces and party affiliations and lists only their names and their stances on important issues. It embarrasses me to be an American when fellow citizens vote on the basis of celebrity endorsements, sex and race. I think we need to look at the real issues of Iraq, immigration, education, poverty, health care, national security, maintenance of our roads and bridges, English as our national language, etc. I want to know how these issues would be handled. Then I will make my decision.<br>Suzanne Caravella, EAST WINDSOR, N.J., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I am 75 years old, and my husband is 80. We have an annual income considerably less than $50,000. We no longer have children to raise or educate, our medical insurance is adequate, and we take advantage of the elderly tax credit. Obama has proposed eliminating income taxes for senior citizens at our income level, but why should we not be expected to pay our fair share of federal taxes? I surely hope that he does not believe our votes are for sale.<br>Patricia Gershon, LAVERNE, CALIF., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Caught Between Color Lines</strong><br>In “The Identity Card,” Shelby Steele offered an insightful, thought-provoking examination of race in politics [Dec. 10]. I have a couple of questions, though. What exactly are black values vs. white values? What white shame does he believe binds my actions? He stated that “racist societies make race into a hard fate,” yet he perpetuated racist beliefs in his article. Each individual is a cornucopia of various physical and behavioral traits. No single trait, most certainly not the pigment in one’s skin, remotely defines any of us. If we want to end racism, let us end the practice of using accepted but clearly racist words to define individuals. The truth will set us free; let’s open our eyes to that truth.<br>John Conlin, LITTLETON, COLO., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It may be simplistic to think that whites are desperately wanting blacks to give them approval for their “enlightened” racial views. As someone who for the past 20 years has spent time in black neighborhoods doing everything from feeding the homeless to tutoring students in college math, I am painfully aware that many blacks are themselves racist. Many of those I know think that discrimination against whites is a mark of racial solidarity rather than a prejudice to be minimized and eventually abandoned. So I’m doing what I do because I was poor once myself, and I know how the soul of many can be impoverished by being poor. Personal approval is only a rare bit of icing on the cake. Most likely, Steele has a few masks of his own that become apparent only by reading between the lines of his article.<br>Frank Kizer, BARTLETT, TENN., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think the points Steele explored have been swimming through the minds of many Americans without quite reaching the surface. I especially loved his description of black public figures as either “bargainers” or “challengers” and how he aptly identified the merits and liabilities of each. It’s interesting that Obama might lose some of the black vote to Clinton, but she might lose some of the women’s vote to him. I am torn between wanting Obama to be a challenger and being thankful he is a bargainer, but more than that, I agree with Steele in calling for Obama “to reveal what he truly believes as an individual.”<br>Raquel Gonzalez, HARRISBURG, PA., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Is Steele trying to reduce the remarkable achievements of Winfrey and Obama — two of our country’s most compelling citizens — to their ability to make whites “think well of themselves”? Those who accept Steele’s soul-crushingly cynical view should realize that they are also embracing the belief that no progress has been made on racism in the U.S., and it will always be an insurmountable problem. How can Steele so blithely discount the tantalizing possibility that we are witnessing a truly new day? Millions of black and white Americans deeply admire Oprah Winfrey and Senator Obama for their character, energy and ideas, not because of skin color or guilt. Every step Americans take toward common ground will bring all those who sell hopelessness a step closer to a richly deserved obscurity.<br>Margaret E. Young, WEATHERFORD, TEXAS, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In his book The Content of our Character, Steele promoted the notion that the U.S. suffers from “race fatigue.” America may be tired, but Steele seems exhausted. He now reminds us blacks why we view his analysis as suspect and influenced by self-hate. Steele seems desperate to transfer his racial baggage to Obama. Steele places him in a racial box and then explains to us why he belongs there, refusing to accept that Obama can authentically view himself as an individual who happily lives his life as a black man embracing the American Dream. Steele’s simplistic labels (“bargainers” and “challengers”) disregard the subtleties we employ to navigate our way through the racial land mines of mainstream America. Perhaps he is the one who needs labels and identity cards to know who he is.<br>Preston Foster, LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I am a person of color, and I hope to see the day when a presidential candidate is accepted for what he can do to improve our country, not for the color of his skin. Obama is brilliant, and it is a shame that he should be frowned upon by the African-American community for not being “black enough.” What does that mean? Don’t African Americans understand that comments like this perpetuate stereotypes? Let’s get over ourselves and let the right person for the job lead this country in the right direction.<br>Maria Medina, CHICAGO</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Pushing Preschoolers</strong><br>To those parents who enroll their preschoolers in tutoring programs [Dec. 3], I say let children be children! At my daughter’s preschool, the students learn how to cook. It’s a great way to learn about following procedures and measuring results. They are encouraged at age 4 to write their own names and recognize those of their peers. We measure our daughter’s height regularly. In return, she’s always asking about how much something measures and is very interested in numbers and words. Teach them a second language. My daughter speaks English and French fluently and wants to learn Spanish. I have a full-time job, but I spend as much time with her as I can. She loves being a kid, and we enjoy learning together. For now, I’m enjoying seeing her grow and learn at her own pace and, of course, helping and encouraging her in whatever she wants to learn. At such a young age, being with the parents after school is better than sending children off to another classroom. Love rules!<br>Elisabeth Szentkereszty de Zagon, BRUSSELS</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As an educator I found that bright children sent unprepared to school by clueless parents often surpassed their well-trained peers in reading by the end of second grade. The age-old and inexpensive adage that children read to become readers holds true in spite of anxious parents trying to give an edge to their preschoolers.<br>Suzan Davis, IRVINE, CALIF., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I must question the validity of the brain-imaging data that show children are not ready to read until at least age 5. That comes as a real shock to all the millions of us in the world who started reading at age 3 or 4. I guess we didn’t see that study in time.<br>Alan Zoller, DAYTON, OHIO, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>A Tinseltown Christmas</strong><br>In “Generation Xmas,” James Poniewozik described how A Christmas Story has supplanted It’s a Wonderful Life as the favorite Christmas movie of 18-to-41-year-olds [Dec. 10]. But he ignored the generation of the moment — the boomers. We too have our own iconic Christmas movie: National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation. Clark Griswold personifies all of our ideals to the extreme. Every year we confront the hassles of “exterior illumination,” the perfect tree, the extravagant and costly family gifts, the visiting relatives who wish they were somewhere else, the big dinner, the disorganized cleanup afterward and the demolished, sad-looking house we are left with. Yet despite it all, we never fail to say to ourselves, “We did it.” When we watch the movie every year, we are not laughing at Griswold’s unreal expectations or foibles — we are laughing at ourselves.<br>Craig J. Miller, DUNCANSVILLE, PA., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Poniewozik never mentioned that A Christmas Story was narrated and written by Jean Shepherd, who based the film on his memories of growing up in Indiana. Shepherd was the author of many books and is fondly remembered by millions for his brilliant radio monologues in the 1950s and ’60s. He deserves credit for the movie.<br>Vince Treacy, WASHINGTON</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>A Stem-Cell Breakthrough?</strong><br>Michael Kinsley’s commentary about stem-cell research was disappointing, especially in that he let emotional rhetoric overshadow scientific evidence [Dec. 10]. Many cures and treatments have been derived from stem cells — but none from embryonic cells. Ethically sound adult stem cells, which have been studied for 30 years, are a proven source of medical advances, so we haven’t “lost years” of treatment development. Moreover, taxpayer dollars weren’t used to fund the destruction of human life in that time. It was a moral stand President George W. Bush made. Let’s move on with consensus on this new research.<br>Ronald Simpson, M.D.,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, MOUNTAIN VIEW, ARK., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kinsley is on solid moral ground in excoriating Bush for disallowing stem-cell research during the almost seven years of his regime. It is heartbreaking to think how many lives could have been saved had scientists been allowed more leverage in their approach to curing many of the diseases that ravage humanity. The Administration’s posture on this issue is a symptom of a broader problem: the gradual incursion of personal religious beliefs into the fabric of our government. The integration of church and state is a dangerous trend threatening the personal freedoms that America has always respected.<br>Bill Gottdenker, MOUNTAINSIDE, N.J., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Treating Parkinson’s disease is much more complicated than just using stem cells to produce more dopamine, as Kinsley wishes. Stem-cell growth and dopamine production can’t always be controlled, and too much dopamine can cause involuntary movements and hallucinations. Embryonic stem cells transplanted or injected into the brain have produced mixed results in both animals and humans. Parkinson’s affects the whole brain, and dopamine alone cannot cure it. Why should I hope for an ethical cure? My wife has been living with Parkinson’s for nine years.<br>Steve Maloney, FRANKLIN, KY., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I am a high school student who avidly supports stem-cell research. I like that Kinsley brought to light the fact that the embryonic stem cells used in research come from fertility clinics, which otherwise would discard them. The advances scientists have made without government funding prove that with the necessary backing, we could be well on the way to curing Parkinson’s and myriad other illnesses.<br>Jessica McLellan, MISSOURI CITY, TEXAS, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Facts About the FISA Bill</strong><br>Joe Klein recently criticized the Restore Act, also known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), claiming that it “would require the surveillance of every foreign-terrorist target’s calls to be approved by the FISA court” [Dec. 3]. This is incorrect. The restore Act creates “basket” authorizations to allow widespread surveillance of foreign powers (like al-Qaeda) and their agents. To prevent a repeat of the Bush Administration’s extralegal warrantless-wiretapping program, the court must approve the parameters of the group surveillance to ensure that warrants are still obtained for Americans’ communications. But no court orders are required for surveillance of foreigners reasonably believed to be outside the country. The bill simply will not make our intelligence agencies get thousands of warrants for foreign terrorists. The restore Act’s blend of Executive Branch flexibility, court approval and congressional oversight is calibrated to ensure that the fight against terrorism is conducted in an efficient and constitutional manner. We would hope that Klein, having studied the restore Act further, is no longer so confused as to continue to characterize our system of constitutional checks and balances as “well beyond stupid.”<br>John Conyers Jr. and Silvestre Reyes, Chairmen, House Committee on Judiciary and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, WASHINGTON</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Mending a Split City</strong><br>After reading “Jerusalem Divided,” I can’t believe that no one has put forward the obvious solution: make it a federal district similar to Washington or Canberra [Dec. 3]. Palestine and Israel could base their federal government headquarters in the city, which could be ruled by a council made up of equal numbers of Christians, Muslims and Jews. That way, the important religious shrines and places of worship would be available to all, city services would be controlled by people who actually live there, and perhaps emergency personnel would be free to respond to anyone who needs their services without waiting for a police escort. This is surely a better plan than trying to figure out how to subdivide a city that is thousands of years old and whose residents refuse to settle into Jewish-only or Muslim-only enclaves.<br>Clayton Philbrook, MATINICUS, MAINE, U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Is it naive to believe that Jerusalem could become an independent sovereign city-state like the Vatican? Let the international community via the U.N. take the initial responsibility to make it safe and available to all people and religions, ending this chronic, divisive tug-of-war.<br>Ken Lomasney, HOMER GLEN, ILL., U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jerusalem’s Jewish leaders should treat Arab residents of the city as equals to end the suffering and anguish that is poisoning life in our Holy City and Holy Land. By our, I speak for all Christians, Muslims and Jews (in no particular order).<br>Daniel Berenyi, HONOLULU</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Captioning the Action</strong><br>I was shocked to read in “The Best Inventions of the Year” that you gave credit to a foreign university for a wireless captioning-subtitling glasses prototype without acknowledging innovators here in the U.S. who have been working on this technology for almost a decade [Nov. 19]. The Georgia Tech Research Institute is already in the final stages of commercial development of a wireless captioning-subtitling system in collaboration with a licensee and leaders in the movie industry. TIME’s failure to recognize long-standing innovators in this area and inability to perform due diligence are very disheartening.<br>Leanne West, Senior Research Scientist, Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory, Georgia Tech Research Institute, ATLANTA</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Still a Bazaar of the Arts</strong><br>I was very interested in your cover story on the supposed death of French culture [Dec. 3]. Do you believe that French people are megalomaniacs who crave the world’s attention? French culture doesn’t have to depend on others’ desires. Certainly, France’s contemporary literary geniuses don’t get the recognition they deserve, but even our best movies don’t enjoy the same amount of advertising that Hollywood movies do. France is no less a bazaar of arts, music and literature than is any other country. French culture isn’t in decline. France’s population has only become more ethnically diverse, which wasn’t expected. If France isn’t understood today, it will be tomorrow — it will always be a part of the world’s culture.<br>Anissa Desuzinge, LA GARDE, FRANCE</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How do you know it is the death of French culture? Because it doesn’t sell in countries where culture is supposed to be bankable? Thank God! That’s what makes it unique! You mention L’Auberge Espagnole as a symbol of the renewal of French cinema, but that was five years ago. The Taxi movies? Yes, they were blockbusters, but they were also the lousiest films made by Luc Besson. His artistic achievements were Nikita, Subway, Le Grand Bleu and Léon — and those were years ago. French culture is about intimacy. We French live in a cultural world that is very different from the Americans’, so before even beginning to judge ours, please do your homework. Learn French, read our books and our cultural press, see our movies, go to the hundreds of venues in Paris where you can get a taste of the new French sound, and think twice before making such ludicrous assertions — and a fool of yourself.<br>Hélène Bablon, PARIS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tcWtibIVwu8GapJpln6N6tbTEZqafnpWjwKrCxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
