At first, they thought the 7-year-old was going to be a singer when music started blaring over the stage. But, what happened next totally shocked everyone including Simon Cowell. Check out his hilarious audition below that completely humiliated Simon.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jj-pantano-roasted-simon-cowell-and-the-agt-champions-judges>JJ Pantano Roasted Simon Cowell And The ‘AGT: Champions’ Judges</h2><p>JJ previously earned the Golden Buzzer on Australia’s Got Talent and made it to the Semi-Finals. He did not hold back at all on ‘AGT: Champions’ during his roast of the judges. “Did you know that backstage there are five hairdressers, three makeup artists, a wardrobe department and a whole team of nutritionists?” JJ asked. “And that’s just to maintain <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon’s new look.</a>” The crowd was sent into a pool of laughter and Simon was totally trying to hide his look of shock and embarrassment.</p><p>“Heidi, my mom told me that you are a Victoria’s Secret supermodel and she showed me one of your videos…but then dad came home from work and we watched all of your videos over and over again” he continued. “Alesha Dixon, you started your career as a singer and sold 42 million albums and won 15 Grammys…oh wait a minute, that’s Alicia Keys.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OUCH! SAVAGE KID COMEDIANS ROAST SIMON COWELL AND THE JUDGES ON ‘GOT TALENT’ [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>“Howie Mandel, I found out that you were in 40 movies in your whole career, 40 movies can you believe it? he asked. “Yeah me neither, I haven’t’ heard of any of them.” He then went after host Terry Crews’ past football career. “Big Terry, for seven years you were a pro footballer and played 32 games,” JJ said. “I’m 7 years old and I’ve played more games than that.” The judges thought his act was absolutely hilarious and gave him a standing ovation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jj-made-it-through-to-the-semi-finals>JJ Made It Through To The Semi-Finals</h3><p>The judges sent him through to the Semi-Finals in the Judges’ Choice. In the Semi-Finals, JJ once again roasted the judges. “Simon I did find out that you wanna be like cryogenically frozen when you die,” the Australian kid comedian said. “After some of the things you said on the show I’m not sure you can get any colder. Looking at your face now I think you’ve started the process already.” Simon thought this was hilarious. Though he was eliminated in the Semi-Finals of ‘AGT: Champions’, JJ was one of the most memorable acts of the entire competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Simon was totally humiliated during JJ’s act.
