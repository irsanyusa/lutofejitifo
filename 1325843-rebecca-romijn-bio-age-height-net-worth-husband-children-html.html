I think it was from my years of swimming in school when I was a kid and it just overdeveloped my upper body. In fact, when I started modeling, my back was so developed, I could not fit into any dresses.</li><li>Hour-long TV is no joke. It tests you as a human being. It makes you a stronger person, but it's really crazy.</li><li>I think life throws enough curveballs that you shouldn't make such a big deal out of everything.</li><li>I guess I can be a little neurotic sometimes, but can't everybody?</li><li>I've been messing around in the studio the last couple of years. But I don't want to worry about being taken seriously as a singer. It just really feels good to do it.</li><li>I've become really good at turning down the boring, pretty girl roles, the trophy wife, supermodel, beautiful girlfriend roles. I mean, playing somebody who's perfect holds no allure for me, whatsoever. It's just boring.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8e8a8c83fe2da7d2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exciting facts about Annamarie Tendler: Who is John Mulaney's wife?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dafa553485b6ae9e.jpg><ul><li>I'm a diligent person, and that came directly from having hardworking parents.</li><li>Movie making is really, it's a director's medium, it's not even so much an actor's medium.</li><li>I was never a girl who dreamed about what her wedding day would be like, but I've always dreamed about decorating my baby's nursery.</li><li>I think to make any relationship work it just takes a tremendous amount of effort and accepting of one another.</li><li>Sometimes I'm so tired, I look down at what I'm wearing, and if it's comfortable enough to sleep in, I don't even make it into my pajamas. I'm looking down, and I'm like, 'T-shirt and stretchy pants? Yup, that's fine. It's pajama-y, good night.'</li><li>Being a mom makes me feel whole and like I understand the meaning of life.</li><li>It's pronounced "romaine", like the lettuce.</li><li>I don't know where it's coming from, but I think studios are finally realizing that people want to see girls who can kick butt as well as guys can.</li><li>Aging has never been scary to me.

I've always thought that was attractive.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5c5abfbf2329bfd9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Bridget Moynahan?
