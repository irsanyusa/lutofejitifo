Clinical trials have shown it to be effective: a February 2022 report found that it reduced the risk of progression to severe Covid-19 in most patients by 89%.
“It remains an important treatment option for people at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including those with prior immunity,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Patients prescribed Paxlovid take a total of 30 pills: three pills twice a day for five days.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>How effective is Paxlovid for treating COVID-19?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Based on studies conducted so far, Paxlovid should be prescribed within five days of symptoms appearing for the best chance of success.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Studies<a href=# rel=noopener> have shown that</a> Paxlovid has strong efficacy for treating COVID-19 for patients who are at-risk at developing a severe case. It is particularly effective among adults who are unvaccinated, had never had COVID-19, and were either 18 years of age and older and at risk of progressing to severe disease, or older than 60.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A clinical trial that evaluated COVID-19’s effect on high risk patients referred to by the FDA as the EPIC-HR trial, <a href=# rel=noopener>showed that</a> Paxlovid reduced the number of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths 28 days after contracting the virus by 86%. The study, completed between July and December 2021, looked at patients who were symptomatic and unvaccinated. Other studies <a href=#>also show that the drug has limited benefits</a> for people who do not have risk factors for serious disease.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In March 2022, Pfizer <a href=# rel=noopener>announced the launch</a> of a clinical trial studying the safety and success of Paxlovid in children and teenagers between 6 and 17 years old. The results of that trial have not yet been released.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2022, when prescriptions for Paxlovid were initially on the rise, the treatment was “remains highly effective and is mainly well tolerated,” with the different variants, Dr. Zenobia Brown, medical director and vice president of population health care management at Northwell Health, told TIME. “However, we may be facing a situation where a longer course is warranted for some patients, especially those who receive the drug very early in their disease course and/or are immunocompromised.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But scientists are not all that <a href=# rel=noopener>sure of its efficacy</a> as the virus continues to mutate. Research has shown that Paxlovid works against Omicron subvariant EG.5, which is the dominant strain in the U.S. It is still not clear if Paxlovid works against Omicron subvariant BA.2.86, a coronavirus variant <a href=# rel=noopener>first detected in late July</a> that has more than 30 mutations. Doctors say that means the virus has the “potential to bypass immune defenses both from natural infection and prior vaccination,” <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Yale Medicine</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>How can you get Paxlovid?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paxlovid is currently authorized for use in people ages 12 and up, weighing at least 88 pounds, who test positive for COVID-19 and are at high risk of developing severe illness. This includes individuals who have underlying conditions such as cancer or diabetes or <a href=# rel=noopener>who are 50 or older</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, the FDA says you should talk to your doctor about using Paxlovid.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Aside from physicians, state-licensed pharmacists can also prescribe Paxlovid under the <a href=# rel=noopener>emergency use authorization</a> issued by the FDA</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What are the side effects of Paxlovid?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are a few side effects to watch out for. One is<a href=# rel=noopener> dysgeusia</a>, which negatively affects your sense of taste; it’s a side effect also listed for other drugs like antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, and antihistamines. Over 5% of the participants in Pfizer’s clinical trial experienced this side effect.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While each person’s experience can vary, many people who get this describe it as having a bitter or metallic taste in their mouths. “It tastes terrible—but not terrible enough to make most people stop therapy,” says Dr. Paul Sax, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other common<a href=# rel=noopener> side effects</a> include diarrhea, muscle aches, and high blood pressure. “These side effects are relatively minor, and the drug is well tolerated by most,” says Brown. “The larger issue with Paxlovid… is that the drug is metabolized by the same enzymes that metabolize many common medications. In some instances, those interactions can increase or decrease drug levels dangerously or reduce the amount of drug and efficacy of the Paxlovid.” For example, she points out that “patients who are on hormonal contraceptives are asked to use a backup method.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ritonavir can also cause<a href=# rel=noopener> liver problems</a>, so patients with a history of liver problems or pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or<a href=#> hepatitis</a>, should talk to their doctor before taking the medicine. Paxlovid is also not recommended for patients with severe kidney problems, while those with moderate kidney issues may need a different dosage level.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Both active ingredients in Paxlovid may also interact with other medications—<a href=# rel=noopener>such as</a> immunosuppressants for organ transplant recipients and blood thinners—so the<a href=# rel=noopener> FDA advises people</a> to first talk to their doctor about any medications they are taking.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Can Paxlovid help with Long COVID?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is some evidence that Paxlovid can help with long COVID.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An <a href=# rel=noopener>analysis of federal health data</a> by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care system in March found that Paxlovid decreased the probability of contracting <a href=#>long COVID </a>by 26% over the course of six months.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Our research reinforces such theories. It stands to reason that an antiviral drug—one that suppresses viral replication—may reduce the risk of long COVID,” <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> senior author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, a Washington University clinical epidemiologist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWdqfXR9jqmYsaSfq7alecKoraKcXWaGbsDRnpitpZWjwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
