Tom himself addressed the change in a tweet this week.</strong></p><p>Tom and his co-host Erin Andrews were fired from the show before the newest season, which premieres later this month. Tom had been on the show for 15 years, and <a href=#>tweeted in July</a> that it was “the most unexpected gift of my career.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/Tom_Bergeron/status/1301273381052936192</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Bergeron Changes His Twitter Bio</h2><p>After <a href=#>the cast for Season 29</a> of Dancing with the Stars was announced this week, <a href=#>HuffPost</a> reported on Tom’s bio change, speculating that he made the adjustment after the announcement.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>WHEN DOES THE NEW SEASON OF ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ PREMIERE AND WHO IS ON IT?</a></strong></p><p>Tom’s new bio reads, “Former Co-Host of ‘Footwork With the Famous,'” a cheeky play on the show’s title. Fans seemed amused by the apparent jab at his former employer, calling him “salty.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Tom shared the article on Twitter Wednesday, pointing out that he added the new bio “weeks ago.” He also joked about the “salty” descriptor, writing, “One must stay current on condiments.”</p><p>One <a href=#>fan replied</a> that they had hoped Tom would be a “surprise contestant” on the show after he was let go. Tom replied to this theory with a cry-laughing emoji, so it’s safe to say he has no intention of hitting the dance floor any time soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/Tom_Bergeron/status/1288980451630039040</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why Was Tom Fired From ‘Dancing With The Stars’?</h3><p>Tom and Erin were replaced by new host Tyra Banks, who is also an executive producer on the show. In <a href=#>a statement</a>, ABC said of Tom’s exit, “As we embark on a new creative direction, he departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>WILL DR. ANTHONY FAUCI BE ON SEASON 29 OF ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’?</a></strong></p><p>Tom’s rep also released a statement, saying, “ABC opted not to pick up Tom’s option. In the fine tradition of Hollywood cliches, they’re ‘going in a different direction.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#DWTS</a> For the 1st time ever, I won't be watching.

This is probably this show's final season.</p>— Patti * (@patti_1956) <a href=#>September 2, 2020</a></figure><p>The former host hasn’t let up on the snarky comments about his departure. In July, he posted a photo of himself at the grocery store, reading a tabloid article about why he “was really fired.”</p><p>Season 29 of Dancing with the Stars premieres September 14 on ABC. With so many fans expressing their outrage over Tom’s firing, it will be interesting to see what the response will be to the new season.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dancing-With-The-Stars-Derek-Hough-Tyra-Banks-Len-Goodman.jpg alt="Tyra Banks Teases Derek Hough’s ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Return — Will It Be As A Judge Or A Pro?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Tom Bergeron</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yKxkraedYq%2Bmvsaeqaimo2K7psOMra6irKSav26uyKhkmmWUnrRurdNmm5qmk567qHnWoquhZaSdsm6%2F05qprGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
