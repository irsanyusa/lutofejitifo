For example, if you know the word ‘cook’, simply adding a prefix can give you </span><b>undercook</b><span> or </span><b>overcook</b><span>. Understanding what a prefix means can also allow you to work out possibly unfamiliar words such as </span><b>submarine</b><span>.</span></p><p>Prefixes are useful in lots of different situations, from the office to the visa office.</p><h3><strong>So let’s help your vocabulary grow!</strong></h3><h3><b>Pre</b></h3><p><span>‘Pre’ means ‘before’. We can see it in the word </span><b><i>prefix</i></b><span> – the subject of our blog – which means to fix something before another word.</span></p><p><span>We could be given a </span><b><i>preview</i></b><span> of something, or a view of something before the hoi polloi.</span></p><p><span>Babies can be born </span><b><i>premature</i></b><span>, or before they have fully matured.</span></p><h3><b>Post</b></h3><p><span>‘Post’ is the opposite of ‘pre’, so it means ‘after’. Many </span><i><span>premature</span></i><span> babies need a lot of </span><b><i>postnatal</i></b><span> – or after birth – care.</span></p><p><span>A </span><b><i>postgraduate</i></b><span> course is a course for those who have already graduated with one degree, and would like to start a collection.</span></p><p><span>And, cricket matches in England are often </span><b><i>postponed</i></b><span> because of rain – meaning they are held later (when it also might be raining, because it’s England).</span></p><h3><b>Under</b></h3><p><span>‘Under’ when used as a prefix means ‘below’ or ‘not enough’.</span></p><p><span>So, let’s say that you’re </span><b><i>underpaid</i></b><span>. Would you be happy about that? It’s unlikely.</span></p><p><span>How about if you were served </span><b><i>undercooked</i></b><span> chicken in a restaurant? Again, you wouldn’t be happy at all.</span></p><p><span>Swimming </span><b><i>underwater</i></b><span> can be a wonderful feeling, but being </span><b><i>underweight</i></b><span> can leave you feeling lethargic and weak.</span></p><h3><b>Over</b></h3><p><span>‘Over’, in contrast to ‘under’, means ‘above’ or ‘too much’.</span></p><p><span>Many people think that international football stars are </span><b><i>overpaid</i></b><span>, for example. And just as, in a restaurant, you might send back a dish that was </span><strong><i>undercooked</i></strong><span>, you’d probably also complain if you got something that was </span><b><i>overcooked</i></b><span>.</span></p><p><span>If you are </span><b><i>overweight</i></b><span>, it’s a good idea not to </span><b><i>overeat</i></b><span> so you can come back down to a healthy size.</span></p><h3><b>Sub</b></h3><p><span>‘Sub’, like ‘under’ also means below, but it is used with different words. Because English just has to be complicated like that. In the introduction we saw the word </span><b><i>submarine</i></b><span>. Marine is connected to the sea, so we can guess that a </span><i><span>submarine</span></i><span> is a boat which goes under the sea.</span></p><p><span>If you watch TV shows or films in a different language, you will probably use </span><b><i>subtitles</i></b><span> to help you understand them.</span></p><h3><b>Extra</b></h3><p><span>A slang word in its own right now, you might know that ‘extra’ means ‘beyond’ or ‘more than’.</span></p><p><span>So we have </span><b><i>extraterrestrials</i></b><span> – beings from beyond our earth – and </span><b><i>extracurricular</i></b><span> activities, or activities we do outside of our normal school curriculum.</span></p><p><span>There is also </span><b><i>extraordinary</i></b><span>, which you might use to describe your English after reading this blog or having lessons with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lingoda</a>.</span></p><h3><b>Inter</b></h3><p><span>‘Inter’ means between, so we have </span><b><i>international</i></b><span> or ‘between nations’; the Rugby World Cup is an international competition.</span></p><p><span>You might be directed to an </span><b><i>interchange</i></b><span> in English speaking cities – this is a place where transportation systems meet, so you can move between buses to trains and trams easily.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I</span><b><i>interstellar</i></b><span> is not just a confusing science fiction film, but also means something that happens between the stars.</span></p><h3><b>Auto</b></h3><p><span>‘Auto’ means ‘self’. So an </span><b><i>autobiography</i></b><span> is a book written by and about the author.</span></p><p><b><i>Autopilot</i></b><span> is a system by which the plane effectively flies itself.</span></p><p><span>A machine which is </span><b><i>automatic</i></b><span> can operate itself, like the doors to a supermarket or a lift.</span></p><h3><b>Re</b></h3><p><span>‘Re’ means ‘again’. So we have words like </span><b><i>reunite</i></b><span>, when you are united with someone again, or </span><b><i>review</i></b><span>, when you should look at something again.</span></p><p><span>We also have the dreaded word for students: </span><b><i>revision</i></b><span>, which means learning again, usually before an exam.</span></p><h3><b>Ex</b></h3><p><span>‘Ex’ has several meanings, one of course is the dreaded ‘ex’, meaning former.</span></p><p><span>While we might not miss our </span><b><i>ex-boyfriend</i></b><span>, many Americans say they miss their </span><b><i>ex-president</i></b><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another meaning is ‘out’, which we see in </span><b><i>exit</i></b><span> and </span><b><i>exodus</i></b><span>.</span></p><p><span>Finally, I said in the introduction that prefixes can </span><b><i>expand </i></b><span>your vocabulary. </span><strong><i>Expand</i></strong><span> means spread out, or make bigger; so I hope this blog has helped.</span></p><p>If you’d like to know more about the English language, we have thousands of lessons waiting for you!

She was born in the UK and has lived in Australia and Poland, where she writes blogs for Lingoda about everything from grammar to dating English speakers. She’s definitely better at the first one. She loves travelling and that’s the other major topic that she writes on. Laura likes pilates and cycling, but when she’s feeling lazy she can be found curled up watching Netflix. She’s currently learning Polish, and her battle with that mystifying language has given her huge empathy for anyone struggling to learn English.
