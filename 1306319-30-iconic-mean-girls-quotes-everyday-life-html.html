Even though she was the white girl from Africa, she was able to fit into a new environment. She was loved and hated in equal measure. The mean girls wanted her to join their crew, but the rest of the school looked up to her to bring the mean girls down. Check out the examples of her quotes.</p><ul><li>On October 3rd he asked me what day it was. It’s October 3.</li><li>It’s not my fault you’re, like, in love with me or something!</li><li>Calling somebody else fat won’t make you any skinnier.

She was the blonde, slow, and blunt of the three. She says the most awkward things without knowing that she is even doing it. She can be embarrassing, and so innocent while at it.</p><ul><li>Gretchen, I’m sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea at Barnes & Noble. And I’m sorry for telling everyone about it. And I’m sorry for repeating it now.</li><li>So, if you're from Africa why are you white</li><li>I can stick my whole fist in my mouth! Wanna see?</li><li>I’m kind of psychic. I have a fifth sense… It’s like I have ESPN or something.

She is not on either extreme. She maintains soundness of the mean girls' group, neutralizing Karen's bluntness and blondness, while at the same time cushioning Regina's meanness. She appears to be the voice of reason. Check out a few of her quotes below.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f0f8e1d7bf9b24d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing Harley Quinn quotes from the iconic DC character</span></p></a><ul><li>Oh my god Karen, you can’t just ask someone why they’re white.</li><li>Make sure you check out her mom’s boob job.
