Since then, the 2&nbsp;have been inseparable, supporting each other, spending a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time together, and <a href=#>participating</a> in&nbsp;different projects. One of&nbsp;the latest projects they <a href=#>created</a> together is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reunion of&nbsp;the stars from Beverly Hills, 90210 for a&nbsp;new series called <a href=#>BH90210</a>.</p><p><h2>Tori Spelling and Jennie Garth in Beverly Hills, 90210</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fae/434/a89bb756be895d32d95fe5c89a.jpg><p><h2>Liv Tyler and Alicia Silverstone, friends since 1994</h2></p><p>Liv Tyler and <a href=# title="Alicia Silverstone" data-link=tag>Alicia Silverstone</a> <a href=#>starred</a> together in&nbsp;the Aerosmith <a href=#>video</a> for the song Crazy in&nbsp;1994 and have been close friends ever since. When the 2&nbsp;reunited years later to&nbsp;recreate one of&nbsp;their old pics (above), their fans <a href=#>noticed</a> how Alicia and Liv still looked young and gorgeous. “A&nbsp;lovely reunion last weekend with my&nbsp;girl @misslivalittle,” <a href=#>wrote</a> Alicia, when she posted this picture on&nbsp;her Instagram account.</p><p><h2>Reese Witherspoon and Kate Hudson, friends since 1991</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon" data-link=tag>Reese Witherspoon</a> and <a href=# title="Kate Hudson" data-link=tag>Kate Hudson</a> first <a href=#>met</a> at&nbsp;the premiere of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Man in&nbsp;the Moon</a> in&nbsp;1991. That was the starting moment of&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendship that has lasted for almost 3&nbsp;decades now. Reese <a href=#>confessed</a> that Kate’s mother, actress Goldie Hawn, was her role model when Reese was at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her acting career. “I&nbsp;am literally her biggest fan,” <a href=#>said</a> the actress. In&nbsp;2017, Reese and Kate together <a href=#>celebrated</a> the double star ceremony on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame for Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.</p><p><h2>Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, friends since 1992</h2></p><p>Nicole and Russell first <a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;1992&nbsp;at a&nbsp;barbecue at&nbsp;Naomi Watts’ house. At&nbsp;that party Russell also <a href=#>met</a> <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>, Nicole’s husband at&nbsp;that time. It&nbsp;was actually Nicole who <a href=#>introduced</a> them to&nbsp;one another, and the 3&nbsp;became friends. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, Russell <a href=#>recollects</a> that meeting:</p><p>“She brought him (Tom) over to&nbsp;where&nbsp;I was sitting. The most amazing thing was that&nbsp;I was talking&nbsp;to, at&nbsp;the time, the biggest movie star in&nbsp;the world, and he&nbsp;had been introduced to&nbsp;my&nbsp;films by&nbsp;his wife, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;was asking me&nbsp;questions, not the other way around. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;pretty amazing experience and we&nbsp;have been friends ever since.”</p><p><h2>Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah, friends since 1987</h2></p><p>Turns out, Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah first <a href=#>met</a> when they were teenagers. The 2&nbsp;friends met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;club where Queen, 17&nbsp;at that time, was <a href=#>performing</a> her rap, and Jada, who was even younger, was watching the show and got super excited to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know Latifah better. In&nbsp;1996 the 2&nbsp;friends starred together in&nbsp;the action drama <a href=#>Set It&nbsp;Off</a>.</p><p><h2>Zach Braff and Donald Faison, friends since 2001</h2></p><p>Young doctors John Dorian and Christopher Turk from <a href=#>Scrubs</a>, played by&nbsp;Zach and Donald, were friends, and their on-screen bromance continued in&nbsp;reality. Zach and Donald post funny selfies and pictures of&nbsp;each other on&nbsp;their Instagram accounts, and they also have their own <a href=#>podcast</a> called Fake Doctors, Real Friends With Zach + Donald, where they look back at&nbsp;the episodes of&nbsp;Scrubs every week.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Lopez and Leah Remini, friends since 2004</h2></p><p>We&nbsp;remember this wonderful duo from <a href=#>Second Act</a>, but these ladies knew each other long before that movie. Marc Anthony <a href=#>introduced</a> Jennifer and Leah to&nbsp;each other back in&nbsp;2004&nbsp;at a&nbsp;movie premiere. “We&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love right there,” <a href=#>says</a> Jennifer. “It&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;those instant chemistry things where you just feel like, ’I love this person. I&nbsp;love being around this person. This person makes me&nbsp;laugh.’ She’s cool and we&nbsp;also have very similar upbringings. That’s why we&nbsp;work well together.”</p><p><h2>Kirstie Alley and John Travolta, friends since 1989</h2></p><p>Kirstie Alley and John Travolta <a href=#>met</a> on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<a href=#>Look Who’s Talking</a> in&nbsp;1989. In&nbsp;her interviews, Kirstie <a href=#>confessed</a> that the 2&nbsp;had romantic feelings toward each other, but they <a href=#>didn’t let</a> those feelings grow, as&nbsp;Kirstie was married at&nbsp;the time. The 2&nbsp;have been good friends since then, though Kirstie <a href=#>admits</a> it&nbsp;took her a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;stop thinking about John in&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic way.</p><p><h2>Al&nbsp;Pacino and Robert De&nbsp;Niro, friends since the late 1960s</h2></p><p>This is&nbsp;probably one of&nbsp;the most long-lasting celebrity friendships we’ve seen. Al&nbsp;Pacino and Robert De&nbsp;Niro first <a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;the late 1960s, when they were both just beginning their acting career. This is&nbsp;what&nbsp;Al <a href=#>says</a> about the moment he&nbsp;first saw Robert:</p><p>“I&nbsp;remember the meeting very clearly. Unbelievably, I&nbsp;saw this guy, I&nbsp;thought, Wow, he’s got such charisma. He&nbsp;wasn’t doing anything. He&nbsp;was just walking. You know, he&nbsp;was Bob. But you felt something from him.” Even though they <a href=#>were</a> both up&nbsp;for the same roles at&nbsp;times, it’s never ruined their friendship that’s already lasted for 5&nbsp;decades and counting.</p><p>How many years have you and your bestie been friends?
