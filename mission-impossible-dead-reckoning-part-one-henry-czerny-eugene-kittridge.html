Actor Henry Czerny is reprising his role as Eugene Kittridge, director of the Impossible Mission Force, also known as the IMF. Czerny appeared in the very first Mission: Impossible movie in 1996 as Ethan’s boss and foe, if not outright bad guy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Czerny has been conspicuously missing from the franchise for the past 27 years as several other actors have taken on the role of IMF director. But he’s back now, tracking Ethan’s whereabouts and lecturing our hero about how he’s going to have to “choose a side” in some great battle to come. Here’s everything you need to know about what Kittridge was up to in that first film, where he’s been, and why he’s back for the seventh movie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One Changed a Major Part of Ethan Hunt’s Backstory</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who is Eugene Kittridge?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Agent Eugene Kittridge is a sort-of antagonist from the first Mission: Impossible movie. The head of the super-secret government organization wrongfully accused Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of being a mole. Ethan proved him wrong (as he so often does). Presumably, Kittridge left the IMF after the events of that film since by Mission: Impossible III, Lawrence Fishburne’s Theodore Brassel has taken on the role of IMF Director.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who else has been head of the IMF?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We never find out what happens to Brassel. He probably died considering the fates of future IMF leaders.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>The 30 Most Anticipated Movies of Summer 2023</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tom Wilkinson briefly plays the head of the organization in the fourth movie, Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, but dies in a targeted attack by the Russians early in that film. In Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, Alec Baldwin’s Alan Hunley takes over the IMF, but he tragically dies during a shootout just one movie later in <a href=#>Mission: Impossible—Fallout.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That leaves the position open for Kittridge to make an ignominious return in Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. Typically, misidentifying a mole might mean permanent retirement in the spy business. But the abysmal survival rate for IMF heads might explain why the government had no choice but to bring back an old director like Kittridge.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Is Kittridge a good guy or a bad guy in Dead Reckoning?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s hard to say. Kittridge certainly hasn’t changed his world philosophy in the last quarter century. He still sees the world in stark terms, telling Ethan in the <a href=# rel=noopener>trailer for Dead Reckoning Part One</a> that he needs to “pick a side.” Ethan has always put the greater good above allegiance to any one government, so these two will likely clash (again) over their differing viewpoints.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Meet Rebecca Ferguson, the Scene-Stealing Star of Mission: Impossible</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it’s Esai Morales’ Gabriel who is being billed as the main antagonist in the film. Maybe Ethan and Kittridge will have to put their differences aside to defeat a greater foe—or maybe Ethan will have to wage a battle on two fronts at once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlngHF%2BjqagrKuZpLtutcyppqyrmZe5pnnDnpidZaKasKy7zaKloGWglr%2B1ec6nnGaglaO%2FunnCs5yrpqlisrazxKecZqOZqcGztcOgnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
