These are reflexive pronouns, which we use to reflect the action of the verb back to the subject of a sentence. The most common reflexive pronouns in English include <strong>myself</strong>, <strong>yourself</strong>, <strong>himself</strong>, <strong>herself</strong>, <strong>oneself</strong>, <strong>itself</strong>, <strong>ourselves</strong>, <strong>yourselves</strong> and <strong>themselves</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>While you might know these pronouns, they can be tricky for people <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning English</a>. In fact, even native English speakers use them incorrectly sometimes!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=A-list-of-reflexive-pronouns>A list of reflexive pronouns</h2><p>Reflexive pronouns reflect the action of the verb back onto the subject. We use a reflexive pronoun when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. Here are nine subject pronouns and their corresponding reflexive pronouns:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subject pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Object pronoun</strong></td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>myself</td></tr><tr><td>you</td><td>yourself</td></tr><tr><td>he</td><td>himself</td></tr><tr><td>she</td><td>herself</td></tr><tr><td>one</td><td>oneself</td></tr><tr><td>it</td><td>itself</td></tr><tr><td>we</td><td>ourselves</td></tr><tr><td>you (plural)</td><td>yourselves</td></tr><tr><td>them</td><td>themselves</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Sentences-with-reflexive-pronouns>Sentences with reflexive pronouns</h2><p>We can use reflexive pronouns as the direct object in a sentence. For example:</p><ul><li>I talk to <strong>myself</strong> sometimes when I’m alone.&nbsp;</li><li>Julie cut <strong>herself</strong> while preparing dinner.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Reflexive pronouns can also be used as the indirect object in a sentence. For example:</p><ul><li>Can you get <strong>yourself</strong> a drink while you wait?&nbsp;</li><li>I bought <strong>myself</strong> a new coat yesterday.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We often use reflexive pronouns after the preposition “by” to indicate that we did something alone or without help. For example:</p><ul><li>My two-year-old got dressed <strong>by himself</strong> this morning.&nbsp;</li><li>Did they make that cake all <strong>by themselves</strong>?</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=‘Oneself’-and-‘themself’>‘Oneself’ and ‘themself’</h2><p>“Oneself,” like the subject pronoun “one,” is not often used in spoken, informal English. It’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">formal, old-fashioned word</a>. Generally, modern English speakers use “you” and “yourself” instead. Here are two examples of the same sentence, with the latter being the one you’ll hear more often in day-to-day speech:</p><ul><li><strong>One </strong>cannot blame <strong>oneself</strong> for other people’s actions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You </strong>cannot blame <strong>yourself</strong> for other people’s actions.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Most grammar books list the same nine examples of reflexive pronouns we included above. However, many newer dictionary editions also list another reflexive pronoun: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>themself</strong></a>. This pronoun is not yet considered fully standard, but English speakers often use it to refer to a person whose gender is unknown. For example:</p><ul><li>Someone hurt <strong>themself</strong> while playing on that slide.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We can also use “themself” instead of “himself” or “herself” when the person does not identify with one gender. As such, you might see “themself” used in tandem with a person’s name or with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gender-neutral pronoun “they”</a>:</p><ul><li>Taylor taught <strong>themself</strong> to cook Chinese food.&nbsp;</li><li>They introduced <strong>themself</strong> to everyone.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Common-mistakes-with-reflexive-pronouns>Common mistakes with reflexive pronouns</h2><p>For learners of English as a second language, one of the most common mistakes with reflexive pronouns is using them with verbs that describe things we usually do for ourselves. This type of mistake may happen when you try to translate something directly from your native language to English.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in English, the verbs “wash,” “shave,” “concentrate” and “relax” are not usually followed by reflexive pronouns:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I <strong>washed</strong> and <strong>shaved</strong> before going downstairs.&nbsp;</li><li>Please <strong>concentrate</strong> on the road!&nbsp;</li><li>You need to <strong>relax</strong> and not worry so much.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish, all of these verbs are generally reflexive</a>, so it’s no wonder people who are learning English make such mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>For native speakers, the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common mistake with reflexive pronouns</a> is using them when a subject or object pronoun should be used instead. This often happens when we have a compound subject or object. For example:</p><ul><li>Kathy or myself will give the presentation on Monday. ❌</li><li>You can give your homework to Ms. Copper or myself to grade. ❌</li></ul><p>To understand what’s wrong with these examples, simply remove one part of the compound subject or object and see if it still makes sense:</p><ul><li>Myself will give the presentation on Monday. ❌</li><li>You can give your homework to myself to grade. ❌</li></ul><p>In the above examples, something doesn’t sound quite right. Here are the original sentences in their correct form:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Kathy or I will give the presentation on Monday. ✅</li><li>You can give your homework to Ms. Copper or me to grade. ✅</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Reflexive-vs.-intensive-pronouns>Reflexive vs. intensive pronouns</h2><p>As discussed earlier, <strong>reflexive pronouns</strong> reflect the action of the verb back onto the subject. On the other hand, <strong>intensive pronouns</strong> are used to emphasize a noun or pronoun within the same sentence:</p><ul><li>Did you make that dress <strong>yourself</strong>? I’m impressed!&nbsp;</li><li>They <strong>themselves</strong> saw the accident happen and called the police.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We could remove the intensive pronoun in both sentences without changing the meaning.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reflecting on reflexive pronouns</h2><p>Hopefully, you now feel better equipped to use words like “myself” and “themselves” to express yourself clearly in English. But it can still be challenging. Reflexive pronouns in English might be used less often than in your first language, and they shouldn’t replace subject or object pronouns unnecessarily. In any case, they are essential tools for reflecting back onto a subject, so they’re worth practicing until you feel more comfortable using them in everyday conversation.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
