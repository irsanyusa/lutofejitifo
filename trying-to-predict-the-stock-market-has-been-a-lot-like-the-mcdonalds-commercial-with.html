 &#34;Calling the market's direction this past year reminds us of one of the greatest commercials of all time - 1993's The Showdown - where Michael Jordan and Larry Bird compete to make a series of successively harder shots through a basketball hoop,&#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Their final shot attempt is 'off the expressway, over the river, off the billboard, through the window, off the wall, nothing but net.</p><p>"After making a series of accurate calls in 2018, we realize it's only going to get harder in 2019. As such, we aren't calling 'swish' at this point and we'll be happy if we can hit the rim."</p><p>Wilson believes the market is entering into a period of time marked by "negative news flow on earnings and the economy," and would recommend investors consider "lightening up" on positions around 2,600 to 2,650 on the S&P 500. That's up 0.7% and 2.6% from current levels.</p><p>Corporate earnings season in the US kicked off Monday with <a href=# id=c0f5173b-e9bd-3543-a70c-2bad323b69e8>Citigroup</a> releasing its fourth-quarter results before the bell.

In the meantime, Wilson recommends buying stocks "anytime we get near our bear case of 2,400."</p><p>He added: "So, if we actually suffer the re-test we are expecting, we would be buyers of that almost regardless of what is going on, assuming it happens on less momentum and better breadth."</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmny1vtiipaBlpKR6sb7EnaCcrF2ptaZ50q2mnKNdoq6zt8StZKGZo2KvprHNZphmpJ%2Bpeq21yp5kraCVYrqksM6nmKWco2KwsLnMnqmcoZGheri106FmnbGXrMG5xQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
