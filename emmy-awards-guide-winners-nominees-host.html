Anderson faced assault allegations, which he has denied, in 2004 of raping a 25-year-old extra on the set of one of his films, but the charges <a href=#>were later dropped</a>. In 2018, another unspecified criminal complaint emerged, with <a href=#>Anderson “unequivocally disputing”</a> the claim.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All eyes would be on Anderson, especially after the <a href=#>heavily criticized emceeing</a> by Filipino-American stand-up comedian Jo Koy at the Golden Globes last week. Anderson, aware of the expectations and potential for controversy, told <a href=#>Fox News</a> that “it’s a job that needs to be done” and “you can’t please everyone.” Meanwhile, he told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a> that—given he is not a nominee for the first time in nearly a decade—he’s going in with less pressure: “I don’t have to sit there and wonder, am I going to win? Am I going to get it? What time are they going to get to this category? I just get to come up here and be myself.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a recent interview with <a href=#>People</a>, Anderson said his mother, Doris Bowman, would be joining him at the show. “I can’t host the Emmys without having Mama Doris on the stage with me, so we’re finding some smart ways to incorporate her into the show,” he told the magazine.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who were the nominees?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the top of the list was Succession, with 27 nominations for its final season, including one for Outstanding Drama Series and three nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series—for the performances of Brian Cox, Kieran Culkin, and Jeremy Strong.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Last of Us, HBO’s zombie apocalypse show adapted from a popular video game, was nominated in 24 award categories, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for star Bella Ramsey and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for co-star Pedro Pascal. The show already racked up several awards at last week’s <a href=#>Creative Arts Emmys</a>, with actors Nick Offerman and Storm Reid recognized for their guest performances in a drama series.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HBO’s The White Lotus also had 23 Emmy nominations, already winning the Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score) awards at the Creative Arts Emmys last week.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Apple TV+’s soccer sitcom Ted Lasso followed, nominated in 21 categories and already winning for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics last week.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read the full list of nominees <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWVqgnOBjp6kprFdlsSivsOsZKCtmZmybsPIp6WeqqNiu7C5yKecnqtdnby0wI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
