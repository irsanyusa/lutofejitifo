Now, to the joy of some and utter dismay of others, new YouGov research reveals that most Britons (51%) pronounce it to rhyme with “gone” with around four in ten (42%) rhyming it with “bone.”</p><p>There are two key factor in how people say the word – region and social grade. Those living in the North (60%) and Scotland (80%) overwhelmingly use the “gone” pronunciation, while those in the Midlands (56%) and London (50%) are much more likely to go with the “bone” option.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Scone20regional-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>There appears to be more of a divide in the intonation amongst those living in the South, East and Wales possibly due to differences amongst local areas within these regions.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Scone20class-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The survey also shows that class is as important a factor in how “scone” is said, although maybe not in the way you’d expect. Those in the C2DE social grade are evenly split, with 45% going with the “bone” pronunciation and 46% going with “gone”.</p><p>However, among ABC1s there is a very real split. The middle classes are far more likely to go with the “gone” option (55%) than “bone (“40%).</p><p>The nation has also spoken about the other major scone hot topic – jam or cream first? Jam first – also known as the “Cornish” method – is the overwhelming favourite, with more than six in ten (61%) adding the sweet stuff first. By contrast, just one in five (21%) go for the “Devon” approach of putting the cream on before putting on the jam.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Scones20method-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>So, while as a nation we may never be able to agree on how scone should be said, we can at least sit down together, pour a nice cup of tea, and tuck in to a jam and cream scone. As long as the jam goes on first of course!</p><p>Photo: iStockphoto</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWuFeH6MoqusZaOYvK%2BxjKCmp51do7y1edKcpqedXZe8r7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
