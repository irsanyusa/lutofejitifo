One of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shelton</a>‘s recent pastimes is seemingly to mow the lawn while also having fun doing it.</p><p>The Instagram clip showed the country star wearing winter clothes while riding his modified lawnmower. Shelton seemingly isn’t trimming the grass around his property though, instead he’s taking a joy ride at full speed.</p><p>Shelton spends most of his time outside of work in his mansion just outside Tishomingo, Oklahoma with his family. Together with his wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a>, he enjoys life at the property known as Ten Point Ranch. The couple loves this property so much, that they had their wedding on the 1,300 acre property.</p><p>Shelton likes his property so much that he used the location to film for the music video of “God’s Country.” The same song is being played in the background of the short backyard joyride clip Shelton posted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Opened The First Ole Red Location in Oklahoma</h2><p>When Shelton first came up with his idea to open a bar called Ole Red, he looked no further than his hometown in Oklahoma to start his base of operations. According to The Tennessean, Shelton collaborated with Ryman Hospitality Properties to make Ole Red a reality.</p><p>In 2017, the first Ole Red branch opened in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. He then launched the enormous Ole Red located in Nashville, Tennessee the following year. The Nashville bar and restaurant houses Barmageddon, the drinking game program. The show is co-hosted by Shelton, Carson Daly, and pro wrestler Nikki Bella. Two more locations opened up in 2019 and 2020, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Orlando, Florida respectively.</p><p>Shelton announced a fifth location for the Ole Red which is currently being built in Las Vegas. Ole Red Las Vegas will put a lot of emphasis on music. With the goal of making sure that visitors not only have a fantastic listening experience, but that the <a href=#>performers</a> may use the best instruments available. The Ole Red franchise is named after Shelton’s 2002 single “Ol’ Red.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_KodiLee_Casey-DurkinNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Kodi Lee, ‘AGT’ Season 14’s Miracle Rockstar — What Has He Been Up To?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWacn5rAbq2Mm5ico6mWv6V5yaiwq6GUmnqwuoyhoKxlnJbEr7nOsJyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
