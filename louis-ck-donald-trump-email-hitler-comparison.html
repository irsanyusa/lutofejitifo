But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the ’30s. Do you think they saw the s–t coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">C.K. is far from the first <a href=# rel=noopener>comedian</a> or <a href=# rel=noopener>public figure</a> to criticize Trump, who faced scrutiny last week when he, at one point, <a href=# rel=noopener>refused to condemn the Ku Klux Klan</a> or disavow an endorsement by former Klansman David Duke.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the email, C.K. said he likes both Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders but would actually like the next president to be conservative because the country has had two terms of Democratic President Barack Obama.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time,” C.K. wrote. “Trump is not that. He’s an insane bigot. He is dangerous.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Recent voting contests have shown Trump dominating the Republican primary. Even as some <a href=# rel=noopener>conservatives mount a campaign</a> to stop the businessman, other members of the GOP <a href=# rel=noopener>fear no other candidate will be able to beat Trump</a> to the party nomination.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">C.K. compared Trump to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, denouncing him for <a href=# rel=noopener>criticizing former prisoner of war Sen. John McCain</a> and for vowing to <a href=# rel=noopener>make it easier to sue journalists</a> for libel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He’s not a monster. He’s a sad man,” C.K. wrote. “But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read the full letter at <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtamRthHN%2FjqWmrqGjYrCsecOopZqklGLBs8HMqWSepZGeuW60yK2jnqpdmLyuvMCroKynnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
