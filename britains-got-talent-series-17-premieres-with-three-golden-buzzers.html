Across the two nights, there were three acts who earned the Golden Buzzer for their performances.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-britain-s-got-talent-singer-earns-amanda-holden-s-golden-buzzer>Britain’s Got Talent Singer Earns Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer</h2><p>On Saturday’s show, singer Sydnie Christmas shared her dream of performing on the West End. She worried <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> when she said she would be singing “Tomorrow” from Annie, since he doesn’t like that song. But Sydnie went on to prove him wrong.</p><p>She delivered a unique take on the classic song, bringing beautiful emotion to the lyrics and showing off a powerhouse voice. The performance brought tears to Amanda Holden’s eyes, and all four judges were on their feet to applaud her afterward.</p><p>Sydnie was overwhelmed by the positive response, as the crowd chanted for the Golden Buzzer. Alesha Dixon told her that she’s “got it all going on.” Holden praised her for delivering “the most heartfelt, beautiful version of that song.”</p><p>She called it “the best version I have ever heard in my life.” Because of that, she chose to hit the Golden Buzzer for Sydnie, sending her straight to the live shows. Cowell told her, “I used to hate that song, and now I absolutely love it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ssaulabi-wows-hosts-ant-and-dec>Ssaulabi Wows Hosts Ant and Dec</h2><p>Also on Saturday, South Korean taekwondo troupe Ssaulabi delivered a stunning performance, as they broke boards while soaring through the air. Hosts Ant and Dec had to wear goggles backstage so nothing would get in their eyes.</p><p>The judges were so impressed, some of them stood up while the performance was still happening. Before they could even give their thoughts on the act, Ant and Dec ran out from backstage and hit the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Buzzer</a> for the group, sending them straight to the live shows.</p><p>After they celebrated, judge Bruno Tonioli praised the performance, saying that “it blows everything else I’ve seen out of the water.” Dixon said it was “one of the best things I’ve ever seen on this show.” Holden compared it to a Quentin Tarantino movie. Cowell said it was “more than a 10, it was an 11.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ravi-s-dream-team-touches-alesha-dixon>Ravi’s Dream Team Touches Alesha Dixon</h2><p>During Sunday’s show, 8-year-old Ravi took the stage and shared that he was diagnosed with a brain tumor two years ago. He brought a group of people who have supported him — including friends, family, teachers, medical professionals, and other children with brain tumors.</p><p>Together, they delivered a choir performance of “A Million Dreams” from The Greatest Showman. The performance brought the judges to tears, and the crowd gave the group a standing ovation when the song was over.</p><p>Before anyone said a word, Dixon hit the Golden Buzzer to send them straight to the live shows. She called Ravi “such a remarkable young man.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tonioli</a> called him “a hero.” Cowell said people like Ravi are the reason the show has the Golden Buzzer.</p><p>What was your favorite Golden Buzzer performance from this weekend’s BGT premiere?
