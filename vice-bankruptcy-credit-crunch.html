The company secured a $450 million investment from private equity firm TPG in 2017, which valued the firm at $5.7 billion — a startling figure for a newcomer. Journalism has been an easy target for advertisers’ cost-cutting plans in an uncertain economy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For others, like Venator and Monitronics, the breaking point came amid looming debt maturities in the next few years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Banks Might Be About to Ruin the Economy Again</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are more details on the wave of recent filings:</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Vice Media</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vice listed both assets and liabilities in the range of more than $500 million to as much as $1 billion in a Chapter 11 petition filed in Southern District of New York. The company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">struck a deal</a> to sell itself to creditors including Fortress Investment Group, Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital. The deal, which will see the investors purchasing its assets for $225 million and assume significant liabilities, allows for rival bidders to emerge.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Monitronics</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Monitronics, which had more than $1 billion in debt coming due in 2024, said earlier this month that it planned to start a Chapter 11 bankruptcy to help implement its restructuring. The company said it would cut its debt by $500 million under the pre-arranged and partially prepackaged plan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Dallas-based firm previously filed for bankruptcy back in 2019, with a plan that gave control to creditors and allowed it to slash close to $1 billion in debt. The company listed $1 billion to $10 billion in estimated assets and the same range for liabilities in its petition filed in the Southern District of Texas.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Envision Healthcare</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Envision, a medical staffing company backed by KKR, had been in talks about restructuring options after it skipped a bond coupon payment due in mid-April.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The company raised more than $1 billion in fresh cash just last year, but it has still been struggling to make good on its debt obligations in the face of a higher interest burden and wage inflation. It filed in the Southern District of Texas, listing both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Venator Materials</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pigment maker Venator’s upcoming debt maturities included a roughly $350 million first-lien term loan due in August 2024 and around $600 million of notes due in 2025. In February, the company commented on challenging macroeconomic conditions, and said it had reduced spending and planned to cut inventory. It listed both assets and liabilities in the range of more than $1 billion to $10 billion in a petition filed in Southern Texas.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Cox Operating</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cox, a closely held oil producer, had been attempting to reach an agreement with its creditors on reducing or deferring payments to avert filing for bankruptcy, people familiar with knowledge had told Bloomberg earlier this month.

The company has $100 to $500 million in estimated liabilities. In a statement, the company blamed regulatory hurdles tied to a new drug, along with “challenging biotech markets and the difficult economic environment” for its downfall.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Kidde-Fenwal</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Industrial fire protection and suppression company Kidde-Fenwal said it will seek options including a sale of the company as a going concern. The company has $1 billion to $10 billion in estimated liabilities, and filed after mounting litigation related to “forever chemicals.” A unit of the company sold firefighting foam containing the chemicals from 2007 to 2013 and has been named in more than 4,000 lawsuits, according to a statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—With assistance from Paula Seligson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamduhHqAjq%2BgnJ1dl66vt9Gup62bqWKws7HDoqtmm6Kqu6S0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
