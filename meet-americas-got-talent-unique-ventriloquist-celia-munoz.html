Since art form is so fresh, fans of the series are dying to know more about her. Here’s everything you need to know about the unique season 17 ventriloquist.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Celia Muñoz Premieres Unique Talent on The AGT stage</h2><p>Fans quickly noticed that Celia’s act was different from others because she took the stage without any type of puppet. Instead, she acknowledged that her audition would be a play on how ventriloquists get ready in the morning.</p><p>After taking her place on stage, she began by voicing a radio station, followed by flossing and brushing her teeth. Audience members and judges were shocked by her ability to sing with her mouth shut while performing other tasks. Not only is her act unique, it is almost perfect. Each moment went over well with the audience, which lead to a standing ovation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/amMxvPO0JBI</p></figure><p>Celia’s ventriloquism is a fresh look at the classic act. Instead of taking the stage with a puppet, this contestant combines music with illusionism to create something completely new. I’m sure it comes as no surprise that this Got Talent ventriloquist has years of singing opera under her belt.</p><p>Before the start of her audition, the 36 year old noted that she was inspired by AGT icon Terry Fator while working as an opera singer. Celia was trained as a lyrical Soprano at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, Finland. During her time at the academy, she worked internationally on classical and contemporary operatic projects.</p><p>She began her career as a classical actress while working with the theater company La Espada De Madera in Madrid, Spain. During that time she participated in festivals such as the Almagro International Classical Theater Festival. She also has won an award by the Finnish Culture Foundation.</p><p>Since finding inspiration in Fator, the ventriloquist has coached with Gary Owen – coach of <a href=#>Darci Lynne Farmer</a>. She also trained with doll manipulation professional and director of the program “Los Guiñoles de Canal Plus,” Javi Jiménez.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-journey-on-got-talent-espana>Her Journey on Got Talent España</h2><p>Celia appeared as one of the first ventriloquists to take the Got Talent España stage in 2021. She impressed the judges with her original act, <a href=#>The Spirit of The Diva</a>. Within the act, she merged ventriloquism and illusionism by making the spirit appear through her voice. The judges gave her the Golden Buzzer for this outstanding performance.</p><p>She later returned to the show with an act featuring her puppet, Joselito. For countless weeks of the competition, Celia showed off her talent of ventriloquism and opera singing. The public loved Celia’s act each week, so it was no surprise that she was crowned as the first ever Got Talent España winner to be determined by public vote. Along with her win, she brought home €25,000.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/COTwXY2FIyQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Fans will find out if Celia made it through to the next round when the Season 17 premiere of AGT airs Tuesday, May 31, on NBC. Since her act is totally new, we think she’ll definitely make it through to the next round.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Original_PackDrumline_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet The Pack Drumline, One of ‘AGT’s Most Anticipated Acts This Season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRorKztcKaqmafn6l6ta3LnqWtZaWjtrLBxGatnqakp7atu9CuoKysXZiyrbXAZqSupp%2BvfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
