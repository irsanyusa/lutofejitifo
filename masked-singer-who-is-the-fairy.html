In her clues, she started by dusting all over, saying “making my debut on Sesame Street Night makes me feel right at home-ish because I grew up in these streets.” She magically brings the feather duster she was using to life! Some may say she’s a bit of a “nepo-fairy,” mentioning she would charge kids in the neighborhood just to see her famous dad “hanging around.” The Fairy held up a police badge with the numbers 966 on it.&nbsp;</p><p>The camera then cuts to a shot of a black panther stirring a cauldron. Fairy claims she “definitely could’ve taken a more direct route to fame“ while photos of Sean Penn, Rob Lowe, and Emilio Estevez appear.&nbsp; She also mentioned growing up with them! Then, a basketball appears out of the cauldron. But she chose a more “divergent” path, prioritizing education and travel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MEDUSA?

The shot zooms in on a rubber ducky ornament. She closes her clues by saying Oscar the Grouch is an old friend! When her performance is over, the last clue we got was from Cookie Monster, a plate that said “ENDLESS LOVE,’ a “timeless classic” that means so much more to her than just romance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Fairy</h2><p>Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg thought the Fairy might be Tracee Ellis Ross. Ken said she sounded “ridiculous” though, instead predicting it’s Angelina Jolie. Robin Thicke guessed Rashida Jones, saying “it takes a repo to know a nepo.”</p><p>Online, a lot of people agree she could be Tracee Ellis Ross, but there are also many guesses saying Holly Robinson Peete, Diana Ross, Zoe Kravitz, and Melissa Joan Hart.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL?

With the voice and all the clues, they all point to one person. And that means the Fairy is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holly Robinson Peete!</h2><p>Fitting that she’s on Sesame Street Night too, since her dad was one of the original cast members! Now let’s go through all the clues that prove it’s her.</p><p>Fairy mentioned “growing up in these streets” and her first television appearance ever was on Sesame Street. She could be considered a “nepo-fairy” because her dad was the original Gordon on the show. When she mentioned she’d charge neighborhood kids just to see her dad “hanging around,” that was a nod to her role on Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper. That role also explains the basketball clue, because Mr. Cooper was an NBA player-turned-basketball coach! The police badge points to another one of her roles, in the series 21 Jump Street.</p><p>Growing up, Holly went to Santa Monica High School, which happens to be the same school Sean Penn, Rob Lowe, and Emilio Estevez all attended. The mention of prioritizing education and travel also makes sense, because after high school, she went to Sarah Lawrence College and studied abroad at the Sorbonne, then considered graduate school or working for the US State Department.</p><p>Holly has been in many Hallmark Christmas movies, which would explain the Christmas tree clue. And one of her first movie roles was in a film called Howard the Duck, explaining the rubber ducky ornament. Finally, the “Endless Love” clue checks out because Holly Robinson Peete played Diana Ross in The Jacksons: An American Dream.</p><p>Do you agree with our prediction?
