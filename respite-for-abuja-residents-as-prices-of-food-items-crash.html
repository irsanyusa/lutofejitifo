We can barely make enough income to sustain our families these days.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“We pray that the prices of these items will continue to decrease because people are suffering a lot.</p><p>“Our customers are also no longer patronising us as they used to.</p><p>“We want the government to do the needful, ensure security, reduce cost of production, and stabilise food prices,” she said.</p><p>A teacher, <strong>Mrs Grace Udochi</strong>, said even with the minimal lower prices, Nigerians are still struggling and finding it almost impossible to feed or make ends meet.</p><p>“The demand for food remains constant, but the ability to purchase has become increasingly strained, thus the urgent need for solutions to mitigate the impact of inflation on everyday Nigerians,” Udochi said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Mr Hogan Abraham</strong>, a Civil Servant, said the reduction in prices of some of the food items was a big relief for parents, especially during this holiday period.</p><p>“As you know most students are on holidays, and most children have formed the habit of eating unrestrained while on holidays.</p><p>“I went to the market on Thursday to restock my house after a long time, and you cannot imagine my excitement when I realised that prices of some food items have reduced,” Abraham said.</p><p><strong>Malam Mohammed Abdullahi</strong>, a farmer in Karshi told NAN that some traders were not sincere, as they always tried to make excess profits off their customers.</p><p>According to him, traders are using this high cost of prices in the market as an opportunity to make too much profit, which is not fair.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Dr John Bello</strong>, an economist has advised the government to promote domestic production of essential goods.</p><p>According to Bello, local production will help to reduce reliance on imports, mitigate the impact of currency devaluation and improve the standard of living of Nigerians.</p><p>NAN reports that the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation report for April showed food inflation increased to 40.53 per cent on a year-on-year basis.</p><p>The NBS said the April figure indicated a 15.92 per cent increase compared to the rate recorded in April 2023 at 24.61 per cent.</p><p>The Bureau in its July CPI report however showed that Nigeria’s headline inflation rate declined to 33.40 per cent.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>However, on a year-on-year basis, the headline inflation rate in July was 9.32 per cent higher than the rate recorded in July 2023 at 24.08 per cent.</p><p>The increase in the headline index for July on a year-on-year basis and month-on-month basis was attributed to the rise in prices of some goods and services at the divisional level.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyzsdKpoK2dXZu8s3nAm6yjmV2nsrS1w56lratdlsBuvNGimp6rXaSzbrLOqJtmoaSaurR5wquYrKBfq7J4g5Oqmw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
