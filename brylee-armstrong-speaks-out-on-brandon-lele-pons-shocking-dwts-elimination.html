Brylee opened the video with a candid statement, acknowledging that while some may question her right to share her opinions on her husband’s job, she felt compelled to speak out given the emotional investment she has in his journey on the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brandon-armstrong-s-wife-speaks-out-about-his-elimination>Brandon Armstrong’s Wife Speaks Out About His Elimination</h2><p>If you missed it, Pons and Armstrong were eliminated from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> on the music video tribute night, despite earning one of their best scores yet for their Shakira-inspired salsa. After the show, Armstrong called out the show, saying, “That one burns,” and that he believes Pons should not have been sent home.</p><p>In a video posted on her Instagram account after her husband’s elimination, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brylee</a> addressed the fact that some might question her right to share her opinions about her spouse’s job. Since she’s not part of the cast. However, she expressed her desire to share her perspective, having been an integral part of their life during the season.</p><p>Describing herself as a “mama bear” for both Brandon and Pons, Brylee emphasized the hard work they put into the season. Despite not being a professional dancer herself, Brylee grew up in the dance world, experiencing tough love from coaches.</p><p>Brylee delved into the issue of scoring on DWTS, noting that the judging this season had been “wild” for everyone, not just Pons. She felt that the scoring system might have flaws, considering the diverse backgrounds and abilities of the contestants. Brylee highlighted Pons’ lack of dance experience and emphasized that her scores seemed to be based solely on her individual improvement rather than a broader comparison with other contestants.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brylee-arnold-believes-that-the-judges-scoring-is-flawed>Brylee Arnold Believes That The Judges’ Scoring is Flawed</h2><p>Expressing empathy for Pons, Brylee shared that there were weeks when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pons</a> delivered exceptional performances, yet the judges’ feedback seemed disproportionately restrained. Despite this, Pons remained positive and resilient, impressing Brylee with her grace under pressure.</p><p>Turning her attention to Brandon, Brylee praised his exceptional choreography for the season and the effort he invested. She addressed speculation about the elimination, suggesting that viewers may have assumed certain contestants were safe, leading them to cast their votes elsewhere.</p><p>Brylee concluded the video with a call for the return of the judges’ save, acknowledging that the unpredictability of the show makes it challenging to predict outcomes. Despite the disappointment of the early elimination, she expressed gratitude for the experience, highlighting Pons’s level-headedness and Brandon’s breakout year.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_MorganWallen_TheVoice_Getty-Images-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Blind Auditions You Probably Forgot About — Morgan Wallen, Melanie Martinez, Loren Allred, More" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wauwpZ2VYq6zudKtqaiml2LAsbHApKpmp6WperC6jJupmqaUpLtuuMSlnGaon6PAbr%2FHqJqkoZ6ceqXD06xknqSZoravrdOipqdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
