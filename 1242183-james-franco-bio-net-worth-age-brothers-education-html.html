Franco attended <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Palo Alto High School</a> where he graduated in 1996 and excelled in his SATS. During his high school years, he was part of his school plays. He then joined the University of California as an English major. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dropped out of campus</a> after his first year, a move that annoyed his parents. Since he would have to wait for two years before securing a slot in the acting program, he chose to take classes in acting at the Playhouse West with Robert Carnegie. While taking the classes, he would work late at night <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">at McDonald's</a> to earn a living because his parents refused to support him after dropping out of school. At McDonald's, he practised accents as he served customers.</p><p class=align-left>Although he went on to secure acting jobs after the Playhouse West classes, Franco was not content with his education level. He enrolled at the University of California in 2006 when he was 28 years old. He became an English major student with a concentration in creative writing. The university permitted him to take up to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">60-course credits</a> each quarter as opposed to the regular maximum of 19. He continued acting and received many credits from independent study and for being part of the <i>Spider-Man 3</i> cast. Franco's departmental honours thesis was a novel that was supervised by Mona Simpson. He graduated with his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA score of 3.5 out of 4.0.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/04f932bd8f1b8998.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing facts about the fabulous Ezra Miller</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39e4f2128628e986.png><p class=align-left>In a ceremony that was to be held at the University of California on 12th June 2009, Franco was selected as the commencement speaker.
