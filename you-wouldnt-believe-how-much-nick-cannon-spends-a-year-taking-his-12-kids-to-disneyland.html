At the time, he only had two kids at the time, referring to twins, <a href=#>Moroccan and Mon</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">r</a><a href=#>oe</a>, whom he shares with Mariah Carey.</p><p>Since having the twins, Cannon has welcomed multiple children. With Brittany Bell, the host is a dad to Golden Sagon, Rise Messiah Cannon, and Powerful Queen. He is also a father to twins Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir and Beautiful Zeppelin with Abby De La Rosa. Cannon also welcomed Onyx Ice Cole with LaNisha Cole, and Legendary Love with Bre Tiesi. Lastly, he shares two children with Alyssa Scott, Halo Marie Cannon and Zen, who unfortunately died of brain cancer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-reveals-earning-100-million-a-year>He Reveals Earning $100 Million a Year</h2><p>While $200,000 a year, it’s fair to say that it’s a trivial chunk of Cannon’s annual earnings. Last May, the media mogul gave a glimpse of his earning capacity, firing back people’s backlash that says he’s a “deadbeat” dad. During his interview with the Los Angeles Times, he stated that $3 million for child support is “not a lot of money.”</p><p>“When you think about my lifestyle, I have to generate at least $100 million a year,” he said, later clarifying that he does earn that much.</p><p>“Everybody thinks Ryan Seacrest has tons of money. I do everything that he does times 10. Well, not times 10 — times three. Because he does a lot,” he said.</p><p>It’s not surprising to know Cannon’s annual salary. For his hosting gig on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> alone, he says he’s paid $20 million. He’s also host to Wild ‘N Out, along with a guest stint taking over for Jamie Foxx on Beat Shazam. Cannon is also the co-owner of the Hollywood Hills restaurant, Yamashiro.</p><p>He also has current projects including Celebrity Prank Wars, Amazon Freevee’s Counsel Culture, BET’s Future Superstar Tour, the film Hollywood Heist co-starring Alec Baldwin, his daily AMP radio show The Daily Cannon, and the #2HateorNot2Hate podcast. Furthermore, Cannon has his own music imprint, Ncredible. At present, he’s also writing his second romance novel, based on his personal life.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_KelseaBallerini_Emma-McIntyreGetty-Images-for-ABA-220x147.jpeg alt="Kelsea Ballerini Looks Gorgeous for Her First Date in “How Do I Do This” Music Video" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Nick Cannon</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK572KisZq%2BfqrmlutNmmZ6kmZrDpnnHqK5mpaWYtW66yJyiZpuRo7uwuoysp56mlKh6onnYnpirZaSWuKq6xmafoqtdZn9ut8idqmasn2Kxqr%2FNnrClmZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
