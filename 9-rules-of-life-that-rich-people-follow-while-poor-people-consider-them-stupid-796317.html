They keep their mouth shut.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/106/bde/eac16455bd96192ea61e4e72bf.jpg><p>Wealthy people do&nbsp;many things differently. They don’t talk too much about their money and they don’t try to&nbsp;show the whole world how rich they are.</p><ul readability=0.46360759493671><li readability=3.7088607594937><p>The wealthiest people&nbsp;I know either dress exceptionally cheap or&nbsp;wear things that are expensive, but you wouldn’t know it&nbsp;just from looking at&nbsp;them. On&nbsp;the contrary, those who are trying to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;impression and demonstrate how rich they are love showing off their designer clothes. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Bran_Solo&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><ul readability=0.46546546546547><li readability=3.7237237237237><p>Wealthy people often understate all that they do&nbsp;and keep “quiet” about their financial status. Their clothes are good quality and tasteful, but nothing draws undue attention to&nbsp;itself. Whereas flashy types who are literally covered in&nbsp;brands, crave your attention and want you to&nbsp;think they are rich. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Back2Bach&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><p>Obnoxious and ridiculous excessiveness reveals the truth about people who went from poor to&nbsp;rich very quickly or&nbsp;who just want to&nbsp;feel like they belong to&nbsp;the group of&nbsp;more well-off people.</p><p><h2>2. They take care of&nbsp;their health.</h2></p><p>Any rich person believes that when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;their <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>, prevention is&nbsp;better than cure.</p><ul readability=3.1806331471136><li readability=1.7872340425532><p>Rich people often use the services of&nbsp;concierge medicine. They pay a&nbsp;high annual fee to&nbsp;have whatever care they need available whenever they want&nbsp;it, without having to&nbsp;struggle to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen by&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor. <a href=#>©&nbsp;LarsAlereon&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li><li readability=4.6013289036545><p>All well-off people&nbsp;I know focus on&nbsp;preventative healthcare, more than on&nbsp;actual treatment when a&nbsp;disease strikes. Of&nbsp;course, they have access to&nbsp;high-quality early diagnostic methods, but each one of&nbsp;us has access to&nbsp;regular medical check-ups that can save our lives. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Anthon Lund&nbsp;/ quora</a></p></li></ul><p>You don’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wealthy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;healthy. Fresh air and a&nbsp;healthy <a href=# title=diet data-link=tag>diet</a> with a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good night’s sleep and the absence of&nbsp;harmful habits don’t cost anything except for the effort you have to&nbsp;put in&nbsp;to&nbsp;maintain them.</p><p><h2>3. They know how to&nbsp;share.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;money itself turns into the final goal, a&nbsp;person loses their connection with reality. That’s why well-off people spend money on&nbsp;charity and <a href=#>establish</a> charitable organizations that have an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;quickly help people in&nbsp;need.</p><ul readability=0.94252873563218><li>Really wealthy people understand that great wealth comes with great responsibility. And those who don’t understand this idea aren’t happy with their lives. They just live in&nbsp;golden cages, instead of&nbsp;iron ones. While people who belong to&nbsp;the middle-class may enjoy the <a href=# title=illusion data-link=tag>illusion</a> that money can buy you happiness, for very wealthy people, this illusion is&nbsp;already gone. So&nbsp;the most important thing to&nbsp;them may be&nbsp;to&nbsp;figure out how to&nbsp;give their money meaning and value, rather than using their status to&nbsp;attach meaning to&nbsp;their lives. <a href=#>©&nbsp;David Frank Gomes&nbsp;/ quora</a></li><li readability=4.7639484978541><p>My&nbsp;brother-in-law is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gazillionaire who has his own business. But he&nbsp;wears baggy pants and a&nbsp;polyester down jacket. Once, my&nbsp;brother asked to&nbsp;borrow some money and he&nbsp;just gave him a&nbsp;pile of&nbsp;money without a&nbsp;second thought and said that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;gift, not a&nbsp;loan. He’s always just been very modest. Apart from buying a&nbsp;nice house and sending his 3&nbsp;kids to&nbsp;good schools, he&nbsp;has just been just saving and investing his money. <a href=#>©&nbsp;catsasss&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><p>Well, you might ask, “Why wouldn’t rich people help other people out if&nbsp;they have the money to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it?” But help shouldn’t be&nbsp;measured in&nbsp;money and the most important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;another person and do&nbsp;it&nbsp;without pursuing your own interests.</p><p><h2>4. They find time to&nbsp;express gratitude.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae7/98a/44186d50e7815a2d3ab6076958.jpg><p>And it’s not about just being polite, which is&nbsp;an&nbsp;essential quality if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;feel comfortable among well-off people. An&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;be&nbsp;grateful and express this gratitude have a&nbsp;strong power over people.</p><ul readability=2.8638838475499><li readability=8.5916515426497><p>All wealthy people&nbsp;I know say thank you to&nbsp;their banker, their gardener, their attorney, their garbage man, their pool boy, and the chairman of&nbsp;their board, because they are aware of&nbsp;the vital contribution each one of&nbsp;them makes to&nbsp;their success. They appreciate everyone’s work and they don’t take people for granted. They make others feel happy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their team. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, they get significant amounts of&nbsp;cooperation and 110% effort from those they work with. This gives them enormous success. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Steve Kobrin&nbsp;/ quora</a></p></li></ul><p>Robert Townsend, the former president of&nbsp;Avis and one of&nbsp;the 20th Century Fox executives, <a href=#>mentioned</a>: “Saying ‘thank you’ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strongly underappreciated way of&nbsp;compensation for doing your job.” Simple words of&nbsp;gratitude help build an&nbsp;emotional connection with people and may even inspire others.</p><p><h2>5. They understand the value of&nbsp;education.</h2></p><p>There’s a&nbsp;famous saying that states: “If&nbsp;you give a&nbsp;hungry man a&nbsp;fish, you feed him for a&nbsp;day. But if&nbsp;you give him a&nbsp;fishing rod and teach him how to&nbsp;fish, you feed him for a&nbsp;lifetime.” A&nbsp;good <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> is&nbsp;this “rod.”</p><ul readability=0><li>A&nbsp;member of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family is&nbsp;a&nbsp;private wealth manager for rich people, so&nbsp;I know what I’m talking about. Rich people invest in&nbsp;their education like crazy. Do&nbsp;their kids want a&nbsp;Maserati? Nope, it’s not going to&nbsp;happen! Do&nbsp;their kids want to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;play the piano? Of&nbsp;course, they’ll have as&nbsp;many lessons on&nbsp;the piano as&nbsp;they want. They invest in&nbsp;the best teachers and the best universities and want to&nbsp;give their children the best education possible. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Priamosish&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li readability=2.8214285714286><p>My&nbsp;aunt and uncle are rich. They have never owned a&nbsp;new car in&nbsp;their lives or&nbsp;spoiled their 2&nbsp;kids. I&nbsp;couldn’t believe my&nbsp;eyes when&nbsp;I found out how much they had paid for the art school for their son. They spent $100k! But this investment has paid off, because their son works at&nbsp;some big NYC ad&nbsp;agency. <a href=#>©&nbsp;kieffa&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><p>New knowledge and skills mean new opportunities for development, personal growth, and increasing your wealth. That’s why education is&nbsp;an&nbsp;investment that lasts a&nbsp;lifetime.</p><p><h2>6. They communicate with people who they look up&nbsp;to.</h2></p><p>Millionaires are extremely picky when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the people who surround them because they know that similarities attract and bind.</p><ul readability=5.3235294117647><li readability=8.9201183431953><p>Sergey Kosenko, a&nbsp;young millionaire, <a href=#>shares</a>: “I&nbsp;have friends who have already started their own business. You need to&nbsp;find the topics that can connect you with people. If&nbsp;you have 10&nbsp;friends and none of&nbsp;them have their own business, you’re likely to&nbsp;stop doing business yourself because the people around you won’t understand you. You’ll have nothing to&nbsp;talk about and they’ll drag you to&nbsp;their world, where you work a&nbsp;full day at&nbsp;the office, go&nbsp;on&nbsp;planned vacations, and receive notifications about the transfer of&nbsp;your salary to&nbsp;your bank account on&nbsp;a&nbsp;schedule. They’ll also joke that if&nbsp;you didn’t leave your job, you’d be&nbsp;happier now.”</p></li><li readability=1.8139534883721><p>Ultra-wealthy people would never allow toxic people to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;their lives. They won’t spend time with people who are poor and only complain about their lives, because this is&nbsp;the reason why “poor people only become poorer.” <a href=#>©&nbsp;Ratna Kumar&nbsp;/ quora</a></p></li></ul><p>Experience is&nbsp;priceless and well-off people think that if&nbsp;you know a&nbsp;successful person who is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;share their knowledge, it’d be&nbsp;stupid to&nbsp;miss this opportunity. They look for people who can help them and have the same vibe as&nbsp;they&nbsp;do.</p><p><h2>7. They don’t spend their energy trying to&nbsp;impress people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec5/900/1d5fd1519da63ff3a25b337901.jpg><p>Owning expensive things doesn’t show our status anymore because most people can afford to&nbsp;buy most of&nbsp;this stuff on&nbsp;credit.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;decided not to&nbsp;change my&nbsp;lifestyle after my&nbsp;income significantly grew and&nbsp;I quickly realized that things aren’t a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;happiness. Owning too many things puts pressure on&nbsp;you. It’s better to&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;experiences and traveling. Memories will last forever, but things make you happy only for a&nbsp;moment. And I&nbsp;don’t try to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with my&nbsp;friends and colleagues. You’ll never know the whole truth about the financial status of&nbsp;another person. I&nbsp;had well-off friends who were in&nbsp;debt and had no&nbsp;savings. <a href=#>©&nbsp;mwatwe01&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><p>Buying things that you don’t really need just to&nbsp;demonstrate your financial status and living on&nbsp;credit are only for people who don’t think about their future.</p><p><h2>8. They build a&nbsp;financial safety net.</h2></p><p>Very rich people often have to&nbsp;deal with “gold diggers” and people who want to&nbsp;get some of&nbsp;their money. They have learned to&nbsp;completely rely on&nbsp;themselves and have come up&nbsp;with 2&nbsp;rules that help separate interpersonal relationships from financial ones: they don’t talk about their income and they have a&nbsp;separate personal account.</p><ul readability=6.750469043152><li readability=6.7436305732484><p>I&nbsp;live a&nbsp;life that is&nbsp;the complete opposite of&nbsp;one that you’d expect for someone who is&nbsp;well-off to&nbsp;have. I&nbsp;live in&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary apartment, drive a&nbsp;used car, and shop at&nbsp;the mall for clothes. I&nbsp;left my&nbsp;relationship after 6&nbsp;years. My&nbsp;ex-girlfriend saw my&nbsp;bank statement and she and her mother began using me&nbsp;as&nbsp;their personal checking account. It&nbsp;started off with little things, but&nbsp;I ended up&nbsp;paying off all the debts of&nbsp;her family. When I&nbsp;confronted her, she said that I’d buy her anything she wants if&nbsp;I truly loved her. So&nbsp;as&nbsp;you’ve probably realized, she became my&nbsp;ex. <a href=#>©&nbsp;MedicGirl&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li><li readability=6.7597254004577><p>Don’t keep all your money in&nbsp;joint accounts. Have an&nbsp;emergency savings account in&nbsp;your name and transfer a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your salary there. I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;finish my&nbsp;husband’s sentences, we&nbsp;would sing together, and&nbsp;I loved him with all my&nbsp;heart. There were no&nbsp;warning signs. But after we&nbsp;broke&nbsp;up, my&nbsp;savings (if&nbsp;I had any) would have helped. Otherwise, if&nbsp;your marriage is&nbsp;over, you’ll be&nbsp;left with nothing. <a href=#>©&nbsp;d&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><p>It’s not about trust but more about perspective. Any person needs a&nbsp;personal safety net, not because they don’t trust their partner, but because this money may save you one day or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;your family budget. And it&nbsp;also makes you feel safer.</p><p><h2>9. They buy comfortable, but not pricey clothes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d1/4ec/d23c2e5c0cad72e5712b18b46a.jpg><p>Money can make you feel more satisfied and help you solve your everyday problems. But as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you buy everything you need, it&nbsp;will start to&nbsp;bring you less and less <a href=#>happiness</a>, even if&nbsp;your income grows. Sounds like a&nbsp;paradox, right?</p><ul readability=1.4525139664804><li>My&nbsp;parents have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money and they’ve earned it&nbsp;all themselves. They have 3&nbsp;rules: “Don’t buy stuff to&nbsp;impress people,” “Don’t waste money on&nbsp;luxury cars. They lose a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;value and they cost a&nbsp;fortune to&nbsp;maintain,” and “Save whatever you can, and invest whatever you can.” Wasting money means going out to&nbsp;dinner more than one night a&nbsp;week or&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;buy all the new gadgets. Seriously, people who have tons of&nbsp;cash don’t pay attention to&nbsp;these things. They prefer to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;good amount of&nbsp;savings instead. <a href=#>©&nbsp;powerlesshero111&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li readability=5.9506172839506><p>Steve Jobs, one of&nbsp;the founders of&nbsp;Apple and Pixar, once <a href=#>said</a>: “I&nbsp;watched people who worked at&nbsp;Apple and who made a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money, but they were so&nbsp;unhappy. Some of&nbsp;them bought Rolls-Royces, each one of&nbsp;them had a&nbsp;manager who took care of&nbsp;their house and a&nbsp;manager above that manager. Their wives went through so&nbsp;many plastic surgeries that they turned into these strange people who didn’t look like people anymore. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;live that way. It’s madness.”</p></li></ul><p>Well-off people are sure that all decisions connected to&nbsp;how much you can spend should be&nbsp;made based on&nbsp;your current financial opportunities and the objective benefits you might get from owning this exact object.</p><p>What rules from the lives of&nbsp;wealthy people do&nbsp;you think would be&nbsp;beneficial to&nbsp;follow?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuvtSlnKxln5t6rbXFnmStoJGperO1wqFkqZ2fpbmmecWoo6Wnp2LEqbXLnmSpp5%2BnerGxzqmjnmWTpLu0tcOeqWasmJq6br%2FTrqeinF1shnd%2FkHBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
