At&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;journalist and he&nbsp;wasn’t famous at&nbsp;all. She grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good family and was the daughter of&nbsp;an&nbsp;editor, musicologist, and a&nbsp;music critic along with a&nbsp;music publisher. Charles dreamed of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;strong, loving family and a&nbsp;wife who would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good housewife and mother.</p><p>One year later, they got married and were happy just like most newlyweds. They were free, young, joyful, had no&nbsp;financial problems, and went to&nbsp;the theatre and social receptions.</p><p>“My&nbsp;best half, Mrs. D, and my&nbsp;dearest wife,” were how Charles often addressed his beloved Catherine.</p><p>“I&nbsp;will never be&nbsp;as&nbsp;happy again as&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;that apartment on&nbsp;the 3rd floor even if&nbsp;become rich and famous,” Dickens remembered.</p><p><h2>Their challenge with children</h2></p><p>9&nbsp;months after the wedding, in&nbsp;1837, the couple had their first child, Charles Dickens Jr. Catherine had grown ill and it&nbsp;was hard for her to&nbsp;feed the child which led to&nbsp;postpartum depression.</p><p>Charles tried to&nbsp;support his wife and was happy that he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;heir. The writer was even more thrilled to&nbsp;have 4&nbsp;more children. After having their fifth child, he&nbsp;grew depressed and it&nbsp;was the first time he&nbsp;complained that the gods were too generous with them.</p><p>“It&nbsp;looks like we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;have another child on&nbsp;New Year. Unlike the King from the tale, I&nbsp;keep praying to&nbsp;the gods to&nbsp;stop bothering themselves because&nbsp;I have enough already. But they tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very generous to&nbsp;those who deserve their favor!”</p><p><h2>Catherine could’ve become an&nbsp;actress or&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer.</h2></p><p>During the time between being pregnant and giving birth, Catherine was still able to&nbsp;show that she could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good mother as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;wife. Mrs. Dickens acted in&nbsp;her husband’s plays and even wrote a&nbsp;cookbook called, What Shall We&nbsp;Have for Dinner? that was published in&nbsp;1851. She collected the recipes to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;Charles’ favorite dishes, some tips on&nbsp;house management for young wives, and examples of&nbsp;reception plans for anywhere from 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;18&nbsp;guests.</p><p>She also turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good <a href=# title=travel data-link=tag>travel</a> companion. Before they had their fifth child, the Dickens family traveled to&nbsp;the US. The trip was difficult and dangerous but Catherine proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong, cheerful woman. Charles Dickens went further into this in&nbsp;a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;his friend:</p><p>“She overcame the first difficulties we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;face in&nbsp;the new circumstances and she showed herself as&nbsp;an&nbsp;experienced traveler. She never complains and never shows fear even in&nbsp;situations when&nbsp;I would think it&nbsp;was reasonable. She is&nbsp;always cheerful and strong even though we&nbsp;traveled through very tough lands for a&nbsp;month without any breaks; she easily adapts to&nbsp;any situations and makes me&nbsp;happy with her courage.”</p><p><h2>The story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bracelet and a&nbsp;scandal</h2></p><p>Their fifth son Francis Jeffrey was born at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;1844.</p><p>For 15&nbsp;years, Catherine either was pregnant, giving birth, or&nbsp;was feeding children. She had 2&nbsp;miscarriages and the death of&nbsp;a&nbsp;daughter who lived for just 8&nbsp;months. So&nbsp;in&nbsp;total, Mrs. Dickens gave birth to&nbsp;10&nbsp;children.</p><p>The English writer kept blaming his wife for her excessive fertility and constant state of&nbsp;pregnancy.</p><p>Catherine kept irritating him more and more. In&nbsp;the end, Charles Dickens came to&nbsp;the conclusion that they had never been a&nbsp;good match. He&nbsp;told all his friends that Catherine was not meant for him and that he&nbsp;wasn’t meant for her. He&nbsp;was too cold and apathetic, and she was too limiting, too overweight, not beautiful enough, and a&nbsp;bad mother. She was also too nervous, she cried too often, and was too jealous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/518/56d96258d49f1bafa0c63be453.jpg><p>After the birth of&nbsp;their last child (probably in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;prevent the appearance of&nbsp;more children), the writer ordered to&nbsp;have their bedroom split into 2&nbsp;<a href=# title=parts data-link=tag>parts</a> and put bookshelves in&nbsp;between them.</p><p>Soon after that, in&nbsp;the spring of&nbsp;1858, a&nbsp;silly and crucial mistake was made: a&nbsp;bracelet from Charles was delivered to&nbsp;the Dickens’ house. It&nbsp;was meant for the young, 18-year-old actress Ellen Ternan. The delivery guy confused the address. Catherine exploded and caused a&nbsp;scandal. But Dickens gave her a&nbsp;simple explanation: “Giving presents to&nbsp;the actresses that take part in&nbsp;my&nbsp;plays is&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular thing, and you, my&nbsp;dear wife, are too jealous and you make me&nbsp;tired with these terrible scenes.”</p><p>Charles insisted that Catherine go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Miss Ternan, hand her the bracelet, and apologize for her insulting behavior.</p><p>Catherine couldn’t take it&nbsp;anymore, slammed the door, and left the genius forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f95/a5a/3c3d2a559d828113b8fad2a0e3.jpeg><p>Later, it&nbsp;was revealed that Mr. Dickens had actually met Ellen a&nbsp;year before this all had happened and rented an&nbsp;apartment for her, her mother and her sisters. The actress accompanied the writer everywhere. But they became lovers only 5&nbsp;years after Charles’ divorce.</p><p><h2>The divorce</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9dd/907/64aec4525a853268d0a8ada2a3.jpg><p>Neither of&nbsp;their daughters invited Catherine to&nbsp;their weddings. They didn’t even inform her about the death of&nbsp;her son, Walter.</p><p>Charles Dickens spoke to&nbsp;the public about his divorce. In&nbsp;1858, he&nbsp;published this in&nbsp;the family magazine, Household Words:</p><p>“Some domestic trouble of&nbsp;mine, of&nbsp;long-standing, on&nbsp;which&nbsp;I will make no&nbsp;further remark than that it&nbsp;claims to&nbsp;be&nbsp;respected, as&nbsp;being of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sacredly private nature, has lately been brought to&nbsp;an&nbsp;arrangement, which involves no&nbsp;anger or&nbsp;ill-will of&nbsp;any kind, and the whole origin, progress, and surrounding circumstances of&nbsp;which have been, throughout, within the knowledge of&nbsp;my&nbsp;children. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;amicably composed, and its details have now to&nbsp;be&nbsp;forgotten by&nbsp;those concerned in&nbsp;it...”</p><p>Their oldest son, Charles was the only child to&nbsp;go&nbsp;away with Catherine. The other children, according to&nbsp;the laws of&nbsp;the Victorian era, were supposed to&nbsp;stay with their father. Charles Dickens didn’t support the communication between his children and their mother but didn’t prohibit it&nbsp;either.</p><p>Later, her daughter Kate wrote about her mother:</p><p>“There was nothing terrible about my&nbsp;mother. Just like all of&nbsp;us, she had her problems but she was a&nbsp;good, kind person, and a&nbsp;true lady. My&nbsp;poor mother was scared of&nbsp;father and she had no&nbsp;right to&nbsp;express her opinion. He&nbsp;was never allowed to&nbsp;express what she felt.”</p><p><h2>“He&nbsp;loved me&nbsp;once.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b4/8f6/48f5c15d169c89a8fb551661b2.jpg><p>Until the end of&nbsp;her days, Catherine lived alone and longed for her husband. She outlived Charles by&nbsp;9&nbsp;years and in&nbsp;1879, she died of&nbsp;cancer. Before she died, she gave her correspondence with Charles to&nbsp;her daughter Kate:</p><p>“Give these to&nbsp;the British Museum&nbsp;— that the world may know [Charles] loved me&nbsp;once.”</p><p>Catherine Dickens was buried in&nbsp;Highgate Cemetery in&nbsp;London with her infant daughter Dora, who had died in&nbsp;1851&nbsp;at nearly 8&nbsp;months old.</p><p>During the scandalous divorce of&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Dickens, many people supported the writer. They thought, “How could anyone live with a&nbsp;wife who didn’t take care of&nbsp;herself, who was always in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad mood and didn’t want to&nbsp;become better, especially when she was with such a&nbsp;genius like Charles Dickens?” Some people sympathized with her: many women understood that it&nbsp;wasn’t always easy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good mood when all you did was give birth and feed children. It’s hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy when you’re not loved and are constantly criticized.</p><p>Who do&nbsp;you sympathize with more in&nbsp;this story?
