Here are some of the examples of short tributes that you could use:</p><li>My mother was an inspiring soul, always there for all who came to her with their troubles. Her home was open to everyone, and her hospitality made them feel important. She was the most loving, humble, compassionate, understanding, family-orientated woman and one of the most beautiful souls one could ever meet. I am going to miss you so much, mum.</li><li>To the world, you were one person, but to me, you were the world. You did not have much, but we always felt like we had everything. You did not leave millions in your bank account, but you left a legacy worth much more.</li><li>You taught me love, patience and endurance. You taught me how to pray and led by example. You praised me whenever I did good and pointed out my mistakes with that gentle voice. You encouraged me to work hard in school and taught me how to read and write. I still remember your voice as you read me bedtime stories.</li><li>Mother, you were the truest, dearest, more than a mother to me. I called you a friend, sister, cousin and also dad when I lost dad. You stood alone for 20 years after dad passed on, and only God knows the inner strength you had.</li><li>You were precious, a gift from God, so much beauty, grace, love and patience you possessed. You touched my heart in so many ways. Even on dark days, your strength and smile made me realize I had an angel beside me. I do not know how I will do life without you.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/237e7bd57757de5d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sweet things to say to a girl that you like: 20+ ideas</span></p></a><h3>Emotional tribute to a mother</h3><p class=align-left>If you wish to pay tribute to a mother-in-law who passed away and you are short of words, these are some of the messages you could use to express your pain.</p><li>Not a day goes by that you are not missed.

I do not know how to come to terms with reality, but I know that you, for sure, are the best mother a son could ask for in so many ways.</li><li>You saw beauty in everything in life; you were a very simple-minded human being. You were the best person morally that I have ever known. You taught us how to live life to the fullest. I promise to keep your legacy.</li><li>Not a day goes by that I do not cry my eyes out because I miss you so much. I feel so alone. I want to talk to you one more time.</li><li>I love you dearly.
