This particular couch is recommended by Smith, who describes it as, “compact, yet stylish.” While you certainly can make it gigantic if you add enough sections to it, its two-seater version is ideal for a smaller space.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: Varies by piece</li><li>Materials: Solid oak and engineered hardwood frame; poly fill or down and feather blend fill</li><li>Fabric: Basketweave, linen, velvet, chenille, twill, canvas, or bouclé</li><li>Configurations: Multiple, with up to nine different-shaped pieces to play with</li><li>Color options: 40</li><li>Price on publish: $899-$1,899</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Huge number of color options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some people might find they sink a little too deep into it</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A neat, good-looking sofa with endless customization options, which can also be pared down to fit small spaces.</p><h3>Best budget modular sofa: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rivet Revolve Modern Upholstered Sofa</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget modular sofa</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Amazon Brand – Rivet Revolve Modern Upholstered Sofa with Reversible Sectional Chaise, 80"W, Linen</h3></p><p>“This is a modern loveseat that sports square armrests and simple lines atop tall, tapered legs, for a minimalist look to match most decor styles,” says Snisar. Admittedly more a sectional than a true modular, it nevertheless gives you the option to rearrange things by moving the sectional chaise to either end of the couch, which can be an absolute lifesaver when moving a couch from one space to another. It’s also a bargain compared to most modular couches.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 80 inches x 34.6 inches x 35.4 inches</li><li>Materials: Hardwood frame; solid beech legs</li><li>Fabric: Polyester</li><li>Configurations: Two</li><li>Color options: Denim or linen</li><li>Price on publish: $1,046.21</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Inexpensive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not as many customization options</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A more wallet-friendly sofa, and lacking some features because of it, but still worth checking out if you’re on a budget.</p><h3>Best modular sleeper sofa: <a rel=nofollow href=#>West Elm Harmony Modular Sleeper Sofa</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best modular sleeper sofa</span></p><p><h3 class=title>West Elm Harmony Modular Sleeper Sofa</h3></p><p>Today’s <a rel=alternate href=#>sleeper sofas</a> are designed for comfort as well as style. “The Harmony Modular Sleeper Sofa transforms your living space into a guest room seamlessly,” says Kropovinsky, by folding out to reveal a queen mattress made of gel-infused foam with a soft, breathable cover. In terms of what makes it a modular sleeper, you can add other pieces from the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Harmony Build-Your-Own</a> page, extending it in any direction as you see fit.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 85 inches x 43 inches x 37 inches (without additional sections)</li><li>Materials: Engineered hardwood frame, solid wood legs; fiber-wrapped high-density polyurethane foam cushions</li><li>Fabric: Basketweave, linen, velvet, chenille, twill, canvas, or bouclé</li><li>Configurations: Multiple.It can be modified by adding pieces from the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Harmony Build-Your-Own</a> selection</li><li>Color options: 155</li><li>Price on publish: $2,379.15-$3,099</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Truly insane number of color options</li><li>Reversible cushions with zip-off covers</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Couch itself is spot-clean only</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A comfortable sleeper sofa that can be added to or extended as required simply by adding new sections to either end (or both).</p><h3>Best leather modular sofa: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Pottery Barn Carmel Lounge Square Arm Leather Sofa</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best leather modular sofa</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Pottery Barn Carmel Lounge Square Arm Leather Sofa</h3></p><p>“While it's pricey, the Pottery Barn Carmel Lounge sofa is a statement piece with endless leather color tones,” says Elizabeth Vergara, owner, principal designer, and lead project manager of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vergara Homes</a>. “The leather is also very durable, so although it’s expensive, it’s an investment piece and easy to clean!

But what it lacks in customization, it makes up for in comfort and kid/pet-proofing. “The Movie Night 4-Piece Modular Sectional by Sundays is designed with stain-resistant fabric, ensuring durability,” says Kropovinsky. “Customers love it for its comfort, style, and quality.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 135 inches x 36 inches (90 for chaise) x 32 inches</li><li>Materials: Multi-density foam and feather-fiber blend</li><li>Fabric: 36% polyester, 26% cotton, 16% linen, 22% viscose</li><li>Configurations: Multiple, with three seats and a chaise that can all be easily swapped around</li><li>Color options: Nine</li><li>Price on publish: $5,180</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Moisture-resistant and stain repellent</li><li>Cushion covers can be machine washed</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The arms, back, and frame need to be treated gently</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An extremely soft and comfortable couch with just enough customization options to let you fit it exactly to your space.</p><h3>Best low modular sofa: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rove Concepts Porter Sectional</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best low modular sofa</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Rove Concepts Porter Sectional</h3></p><p>“I really like this low, modular couch—it has a chic appearance and opens up the space,” says Vergara. “The Porter Sectional is a simple yet stylish sofa, with a boxy design and a low profile. The square armrests can serve as side tables, and the elevated backrest provides good support for leaning back. The high-density foam cushioning is both comfortable and firm, and the detailed pipe stitching adds a touch of modern design elegance.” If you’re considering a non-modular design, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rove Concepts Dresden Sectional Sofa</a> made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>most comfortable couches</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 116 inches x 38 inches (69.5 for chaise) x 25 inches high</li><li>Materials: Kiln-dried hardwood frame; polyurethane foam cushions</li><li>Fabric: Modern felt, plush weave, plush velvet, bouclé</li><li>Configurations: Two (chaise can be moved to either end)</li><li>Color options: Seven</li><li>Price on publish: $3,570 (retail), $2,499 (member)</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Deep seats encourage laying back and relaxing</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not as many customization options</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A low, stylish couch with limited customization but deep, comfortable seats.</p><h3>Best customizable modular sofa: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Allform 3-Seat Sofa with Chaise</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best customizable modular sofa</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Allform 3-Seat Sofa with Chaise</h3></p><p>Allform specializes in customizable modular furniture, whether you’re looking for a loveseat with a chaise that’ll fit in a small room or an eight-seat corner sectional for an open floorplan.

We also ensured that all of our picks had overwhelmingly positive customer reviews.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-modular-sofa>What to consider when buying a modular sofa</h2><p>There are a few aspects to consider when getting a modular sofa, including the following.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Modular sofa prices range from affordable to high-end, and while you’ll want to go with what’s appropriate for your budget, do be sure you’re getting what you need. “When purchasing a modular sofa, you should look beyond the price tag and discern the value that the piece brings into the space,” says Artem Kropovinsky, interior design expert and founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Arsight</a>, an award-winning interior design studio based in New York City. “The couch's essence should resonate with the room's aesthetics and functionalities.”</p><h3>Size</h3><p>“In terms of size, don't view the sofa as a standalone entity,” says Kropovinsky. “Instead, see it as a harmonious component of an evolving space, one that allows the room to breathe.” However you arrange the room, though, you will of course have to ensure that your new couch fits in the space in whichever arrangement you prefer. “Measure your space and consider the potential configurations the sofa offers,” advises Brad Smith, interior designer and CEO at Omni Home Ideas.</p><h3>Configurability</h3><p>“Modular sofas offer a high level of customization,” points out Mariya Snisar, head of interior design at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Renowell</a>. “I’d suggest thinking about how you want to arrange the pieces. Do you prefer a traditional L-shape, a U-shape, or something more unconventional?”</p><h3>Functionality</h3><p>“Think about storage, sleeper options, or other features you might need,” suggests Smith. “Are you looking for a lounging space, a formal seating area, or a combination of both?” adds Snisar. “Some modular sofas come with features such as recliners, chaises, or built-in storage. I suggest choosing one that aligns with your lifestyle and requirements.”</p><h3>Longevity</h3><p>“Investing in a high-quality modular sofa is essential for longevity,” says Snisar. “Look for reputable brands and check for details like the frame material, cushioning, and stitching.” Smith suggests looking for couches with a sturdy frame, ideally made of solid wood or metal. Kropovinsky, though, points out that, “Longevity is more than rugged durability. A valuable piece ages gracefully over time, akin to a timeless wardrobe piece that remains stylish.”</p><h3>Materials</h3><p>“Look for durable and easy-to-clean fabrics or leathers, especially if you have pets or children,” says Smith. The <a rel=alternate href=#>best couches</a> for durability also either feature tightly-woven or performance fabrics.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Are modular couches worth it?</h3><p>“Modular couches are worth the investment for their exceptional adaptability and space-saving capabilities, providing a versatile seating solution that you can customize to suit various room layouts,” says Snisar. “Their durability and potential for expansion make them a valuable addition to any living space.”</p><h3>Why are modular sofas so expensive?</h3><p>“The flexibility, craftsmanship, and often the additional features (like storage or sleepers) can drive up the cost,” admits Smith. Snisar, though, still recommends giving them a try. “I firmly believe that the investment in a modular sofa is well worth it, for their adaptability and space-saving prowess and versatility in function,” she says. “The ability to expand or reconfigure seating arrangements makes them invaluable for hosting guests or adapting to changing room layouts. Their durability and high-quality materials ensure they stand the test of time, making them a smart long-term choice.”</p><h3>How do modular sofas stay together?</h3><p>“Modular sofas typically stay together through a combination of connectors and gravity,” explains Snisar. “They often feature specialized hardware, such as clips or brackets, designed to secure the individual modules together. These connectors attach the pieces at key connection points, preventing them from shifting or separating during use. Their weight and the placement of the modules themselves, along with the friction between them and the floor, contribute to the stability of the sofa.”</p><h3>Are modular and sectional sofas the same?</h3><p>“Modular and sectional sofas share similarities, but they’re not exactly the same,” says Snisar. “A modular sofa consists of individual pieces that you can arrange and combine in various configurations to suit your room's layout. A sectional sofa, on the flipside, often comes in predefined sections (like L-shape or U-shape). You can’t customize it as extensively as a modular sofa.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnaSxtrjAq2Ssp5aWfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
