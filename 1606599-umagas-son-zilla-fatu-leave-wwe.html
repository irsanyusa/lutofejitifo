He said;</p>It's all love. It's all respect. I still want to see Booker T and his school thrive. For me, it was just my vision was different. Me and Book, we already had a conversation and some things can't work. My vision and his vision, what he had lined up, it just didn't connect. We parted ways, respectfully, we're still on good terms. It's not like, 'I don't want to see you win no more.' It's all love. I have to go this way, he has to go this way. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b798e8f7284a7325.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unveiling Turk Lesnar: the biography of Brock Lesnar's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After leaving Reality of Wrestling, Zilla began working in various indie organisations.

My journey's different. My story's way different from Solo's, from The Usos', from Roman and Jacob. So my story, I got a whole 'nother chapter.
