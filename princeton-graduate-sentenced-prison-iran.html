Mizan claims Princeton’s Sharmin and Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies, which Wang was active at, has links to Western intelligence agencies and Israel. The report also accused Wang of copying 4,500 documents. “The American spy arrested in Iran was also at the center and his mission was to collect confidential information and documents,” Mizan said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This person, who was gathering information and was directly guided by America, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but the sentence can be appealed,” Reuters reported the judiciary’s spokesman, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, as saying.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since Wang’s arrest last year, Princeton University has quietly worked with his family, the U.S. government and others to help facilitate his release. “We were very distressed by the charges brought against him in connection with his scholarly activities, and by his subsequent conviction and sentence,” Princeton University said in the statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Several Iranian dual nationals from the U.S., Austria, France, Canada and Britain have been detained in Iran over the past year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcGZlgnOBjqmpoqaTmsGwuoygqZqcpZbBpnnSnqWtnZ6YsqV5z6ugrKeeYrazrc1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
