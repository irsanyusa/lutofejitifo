And that honor goes to Shinjiro Ono, proud owner of Maru, who really is the Best Dog in the World.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru, a Shiba Inu living in Japan, is everything the Best Dog in the World should be: inspirational, handsome, photogenic, friendly, and, most of all, fluffy. He is so, so fluffy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Neither hyperactive nor aloof, Maru’s personality is truly what makes him “the world’s dog.” He’s mellow enough to cuddle with at night, fun enough to play fetch, and he isn’t above a <a href=# rel=noopener>sprightly dance</a> or a totally spontaneous <a href=# rel=noopener>freakout</a>. Can’t you imagine him at your feet as you read this? Don’t you want to pet him? Don’t you want to squeeze him? Don’t you love that his name is Japanese for “round”?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rather than keep the Best Dog in the World all for himself (as one understandably might), owner Shinjiro Ono is generous enough to share this glorious canine with the world through <a href=# rel=noopener>an Instagram account</a>, which has an impressive 1.8 million followers. So, with the help of some Instagram snapshots, here are 21 reasons why Maru is the Best Dog in the World.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">1. He has interspecies friendships.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru gets along with everybody, even goats. And horses.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2. He teaches us things.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For example, how to make “the fluffy ball.” Behold:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Voilà:</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">3. He has a panda backpack (and several other backpacks).</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Why would a dog need a backpack? What would he keep in there? The answer is treats.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">4. He makes the cutest howling noises.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When some dogs howl, it’s annoying. When Maru howls, it’s pure music.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">5. He posts a goodnight photo or video for his fans every night.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He makes us feel loved.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">6. He appreciates his mom.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And makes sure to thank her for helping him become “an attractive big Shiba-boy.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">7. And his dad.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He has so much love for the human who takes care of him.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">8. He eats clean.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And also adorably.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">9. He reminds us to hydrate.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And he sets a great example by always drinking plenty of water.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">10. Maru is universal.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Daunted by the prospect of following an international dog? Don’t be! Maru doesn’t rely on pop culture references to be adorable and relatable. Fluffy is the global language. But when he does make a pop culture reference, it’s going to be universal and easy to understand. And bizarre and adorable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Plus, sometimes Maru teaches us all about Japanese culture, like the annual <a href=# rel=noopener>cherry blossom</a> festival.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">11. He makes a good chair.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru offers support — be it emotional or physical — to anyone in need.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">12. And a good piece of exercise equipment.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru wants to help you be healthy.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">13. He shows great enthusiasm and determination.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For example, when he digs.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">14. His photos are always delightful, even when they can’t be explained.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru is mellow enough to put up with the cutest, strangest photo ops.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">15. He lets his human bother him as much as he wants.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru understands that when you’re a really cute dog, people will want to bother you, and you should really just let them do it. That’s just the price of free room and board and a life of permanent leisure.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">16. Maru’s life is better than yours.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What is Instagram for but enabling your daydreams while you’re stuck at work? Unless your job involves drinking from pristine mountain streams, frolicking in lush meadows, and sleeping and playing whenever you want, Maru helps you dream bigger four to five times every day.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">17. He’s been featured in art galleries.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru is literally art.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">18. He works hard to look that good.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru is a gorgeous creature, and he works hard to maintain his beauty. This video, called “Making of Fluffy,” shows his grooming process:</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">19. Before he was the Best Dog in the World, he was the Best Puppy in the World.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Look at Baby Maru. Look at him!</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">20. He is extremely inspirational.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He sets goals for himself, and then he’s (rightfully) proud when he achieves them. He encourages all of us to have the same attitude.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">21. He’s also extremely positive and has a perfect smile.</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maru is often wearing a big ol’ smile on his face, and encourages the rest of us to “be smile” too.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You might still be thinking that Maru is just a dog. Really, though, he’s more than that. Ono began posting photos of Maru after Japan’s devastating earthquake in 2011, “with the hope of easing people’s anxiety, even a little bit,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>writes</a> on Maru’s website. When people responded to tell him the photos were helping cheer them up, he continued to post three photos a day, every day. Now, four years later, Maru has racked up nearly 2 million Instagram followers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Ono says, “Photography has the power to transcend all the barriers such as race, gender, religion, philosophy, and politics.” Photos of Maru have transcended all of those barriers, bringing joy to people all over the world. He is cute, he is smiley, he is entertaining, and he truly is the Best Dog in the World. (Also, did I mention he’s fluffy?)</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Baby Beckham</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meet <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Baby Beckham</strong></a>, a gorgeous (and ultra-fluffy) Samoyed who spends his days hiking and going for dips in cold mountain streams.
