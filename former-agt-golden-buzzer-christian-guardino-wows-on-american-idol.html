The Long Island singer wowed the judges with his strong voice. As it turns out, this isn’t Christian’s first talent show, as he previously earned the Golden Buzzer on America’s Got Talent.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-christian-guardino-auditions-for-american-idol>Christian Guardino Auditions for ‘American Idol’</h2><p>Before his audition, Christian admitted to the American Idol judges that he was “a little anxious,” adding, “I can’t believe I’m standing here in front of you guys. This is nuts.”</p><p>Christian went on to sing “A Song for You” by Donny Hathaway. The judges were clearly impressed as they listened to Christian’s powerhouse performance. They gave the audition a standing ovation, and Lionel Richie got up to hug Christian, saying, “We found him.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YFjKx7XVa0</p></figure><p>The singer received a similar reaction after <a href=# class=broken_link>his audition for AGT Season 12</a> in 2017. Christian, then 16, admitted he was nervous before launching into an incredible rendition of “Who’s Lovin’ You” by the Jackson 5. It brought three of the judges to their feet.</p><p>The performance left Simon Cowell speechless. Fellow judge Howie Mandel asked Christian what he wished for, and he said to receive the Golden Buzzer. So Mandel gave it to him in an emotional moment. Christian went on to make it to the Semifinals of Season 12, performing Ed Sheeran’s “Make It Rain” and Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-christian-has-a-powerful-backstory>Christian Has a Powerful Backstory</h3><p>At 6 months old, Christian was diagnosed with an eye disorder called Leber congenital amaurosis, which made him legally blind. His vision declined again at 12 years old, at which point he underwent gene therapy, which helped him gain most of his sight back.</p><p>“I have been able to see such incredible things since the gene therapy,” Christian told <a href=#>Fox News</a> in 2019. “Like&nbsp;the moon, the stars, the sunsets, fireworks, snow falling — just so many things that I have had the opportunity to witness. And I can’t take any of those things for granted.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmImWJL_L6c</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>MEET ‘AMERICAN IDOL’S FIRST PLATINUM TICKET WINNER HUNTERGIRL</a></strong></p><p>Before auditioning for AGT, Christian appeared at the Apollo Theater’s Amateur Night. After his time on the show, the singer went on to release original music. In 2019, he collaborated with country star Hunter Hayes on the song “Waiting.” He’s also released the singles “Missing Part of Me” and “Wishful Thinking.”</p><p>After his American Idol audition, Christian earned a Golden Ticket to Hollywood to go along with his Golden Buzzer.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NUP_194134_0554.jpg alt="Pulling Double Duty: the Celebs Who Produce and Star in Our Favorite Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaippp2iYq6owIygpqWclaN6o8HZs5yrZZOdv6q%2F06KYp2WXqq6zsMinpmavn6zAbrvNZpimnaKesKK6jKKbqKRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
