His wife was diagnosed with <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a> and, luckily, her case wasn’t terminal. The man expected any type of&nbsp;behavior from his wife and was ready to&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;it, but life prepared for him a&nbsp;bitter pill to&nbsp;swallow. Let’s dive into Derek’s story and try to&nbsp;help him find a&nbsp;proper way out together.</p><p><h2>Derek used to&nbsp;think that his family was stable and happy, until one day.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e88/d92/ca6bb15bed899720820b4fbd77.jpg><p>Derek, who’s 45, and his wife Melania, who’s 43, have been married for 20&nbsp;years already, and they’ve been together for 25&nbsp;years in&nbsp;total. The man described his wife as&nbsp;the most loyal, intelligent, caring and thoughtful person he’s ever known. Derek admits that he&nbsp;has always thought of&nbsp;himself as&nbsp;fortunate to&nbsp;have met and married Melania. She’s a&nbsp;beautiful woman, and many people have told her this throughout their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. But Melania has always been hesitant about her own appearance.</p><p>Seven months ago, Derek’s wife was diagnosed with uterine cancer, but it&nbsp;was not severe and doctors reacted quickly. She had a&nbsp;full hysterectomy and things were becoming better for her. Derek was never concerned about the woman’s state, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;admitted. Her cancer was diagnosed early, and the woman made a&nbsp;full recovery.</p><p>Derek took time off work to&nbsp;look after his wife after she had her surgery, and all seemed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;just well. As&nbsp;the man confessed, he&nbsp;knew that there would be&nbsp;some emotional behaviors on&nbsp;her part, and although he&nbsp;has never been an&nbsp;emotional person, the spouses dealt with them together. But one day turned their life upside down.</p><p><h2>All of&nbsp;sudden, Derek’s wife turned into an&nbsp;absolutely different person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/748/f0f/5bcead515a9a7d173cb9dabbed.jpg><p>After the woman’s recovery, she came to&nbsp;Derek with a&nbsp;suggestion that they should start “living life to&nbsp;the fullest”. Then, without any explanation, she took an&nbsp;extended trip to&nbsp;another country. Derek was fine with these things, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;accepted them as&nbsp;building memories and crossing bucket-list adventures off his wife’s list. He&nbsp;understood that, at&nbsp;some point, his wife was feeling fragile. She also started a&nbsp;dancing class, taking swimming lessons and even cooking classes. The understanding man was fully supportive until recently.</p><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks ago, Melania came home from work and told Derek she needed a&nbsp;“hall pass”. For her, it&nbsp;meant a&nbsp;one-time opportunity for her to&nbsp;have date another man.</p><p>Derek wrote, “She said that since her cancer diagnosis her view of&nbsp;life has changed, and she doesn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;handcuffed from doing things that bring her pleasure. She told me&nbsp;that there was a&nbsp;guy at&nbsp;her work that she has always been attracted&nbsp;to. He&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;quit his job at&nbsp;the company and Melania would never see him again. She then said it&nbsp;was the perfect opportunity to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;one-night date with someone else. She said that&nbsp;I could refuse, but that she would be&nbsp;totally frustrated with me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;toxicity.”</p><p><h2>The man was totally overwhelmed with such a&nbsp;turn of&nbsp;events.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/854/fb4/20052d5c32a2dedfb10a458a11.jpg><p>Derek wrote that for him, not wanting his wife of&nbsp;many years to&nbsp;date someone else didn’t seem as&nbsp;being toxic. He&nbsp;told his wife immediately that she was crossing the border there and that for him this was a&nbsp;very large issue that could totally affect the rest of&nbsp;their marriage and life. Melania just apologized that she has put such a&nbsp;large decision only on&nbsp;his shoulders and that she didn’t need his approval or&nbsp;disapproval anymore.</p><p>The man wrote about his feelings at&nbsp;that moment, saying, “Part of&nbsp;me&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;explain her behavior, and justify her for being honest with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;know she has been through a&nbsp;lot since that cancer diagnosis, so&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;close my&nbsp;eyes and let her do&nbsp;whatever she wants. But mostly&nbsp;I felt like&nbsp;I was ready to&nbsp;throw away our marriage because of&nbsp;her request. Now I&nbsp;just don’t know what to&nbsp;do. I&nbsp;feel for her and at&nbsp;the same time I&nbsp;am mad with her.”</p><p><h2>We’d advise Derek and his wife to&nbsp;apply for a&nbsp;professional help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec2/722/f029a55d7baedd80ca5cd5c7e7.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are very grateful to&nbsp;Derek for taking his time and effort and writing to&nbsp;us, and also for his immense trust in&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;think that the situation has gone too far and that the couple needs to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;family counselor for better understanding of&nbsp;where they should move further.</p><p>If&nbsp;Derek agrees to&nbsp;his wife’s suggestion, it&nbsp;means he&nbsp;will know about his wife’s infidelity and will kind of&nbsp;agree for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;happen. If&nbsp;Melania takes this step, she may be&nbsp;unpleasantly surprised that cheating on&nbsp;her husband was not something that would bring her satisfaction. And she would need to&nbsp;live with this understanding her whole life.</p><p>So, a&nbsp;professional therapist might suggest the couple some alternative options for their better agreement and mutual understanding.</p><p>And here’s yet another story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who claims he&nbsp;<a href=#>accidentally cheated</a> on&nbsp;his wife, and is&nbsp;now shocked by&nbsp;the way she responded to&nbsp;this act.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edainZ5lmah6onnCmqWcnaJiwLa%2B1aKtqKpdlruledKhnGaZo6CypXnMnmSfp6Jirm7Ax6KloGWkna61ecyam55lna56qa3Iq2SsrJGjsW67zWacp5xdbX54gJVuZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
