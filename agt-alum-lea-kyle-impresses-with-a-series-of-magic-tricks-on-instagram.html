Her magic trick consists of clasping the thread through her hands until it disappears, incredibly replacing it with multiple ones of different colors. Just when fans thought this would be the last, turns out that Kyle was just starting.</p><p>Apparently, the quick change artist has been bringing fans a free virtual talent show since August 14. Her second magic performance was posted on August 29 where she instantly changed her pink loungewear outfit into a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dainty black floral dress</a>.</p><p>It wasn’t a secret that Kyle loves dressing up, since it was seen in her past quick change performances on America’s Got Talent. Reasonably, most of her tricks featured both fashion and beauty. In her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">third</a> Instagram reel, she utilizes a circle-shaped cloth to produce a number of glamour essentials.</p><p>Subsequently, Kyle’s fourth upload demonstrates how she effortlessly replaced her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">black lips into red</a>, converting her lipstick into confetti. Her latest magic video is almost like the first one, except that she’s using a coin instead of a sewing thread. As of writing, Kyle has uploaded five magic video content on the said platform, amusing fans with her unfading talent.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Are Loving Her Tricks</h2><p>Evidently, Kyle has been enjoying creating magic-related video content on Instagram. In the comments, fans have expressed their amusement over the artist’s amazing gimmicks.</p><p>“Your brain is going a million miles a minute and I love it. Keep it up! You rock!” one wrote.</p><p>Even some magicians commented on Kyle’s content, saying that her tricks were perfect. One supporter wrote that her slight hand movement fascinates and frustrates them at the same time.</p><p>“You are without a doubt the best magician in the world at changing clothes instantly, no other magician is like you,” another person wrote.</p><p>Subsequently, fans are happy Kyle is pleasantly recovering from her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">car crash injury</a>. The AGT quick change artist has recently placed fourth in FISM Québec 2022 World Championship of Magic. With this award, Kyle believed that she has a lot more to learn about magic.</p><p>At this time, she is still appearing in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT Las Vegas Live show</a> in Las Vegas, Nevada. It’s no surprise that Kyle is continuing to develop her skills as a magician, with her Instagram reels acting as evidence of her progress.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_KatyPerry_ThomasRhett_KatyPerryviaTwitter.jpeg alt="Katy Perry, Thomas Rhett Release Music Video for ‘Where We Started’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZpmcqrpuuMSaZKSxnJp6qrnPq5ysq5Woeri106FkmmWjmr%2BqsdJmpp9lnZa0qq%2BMramim5uoerC6jKKlrKyRnL%2BiuY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
