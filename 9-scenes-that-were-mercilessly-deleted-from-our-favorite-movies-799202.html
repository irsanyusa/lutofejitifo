We at Bright Side have seen dozens of deleted scenes from famous movies and we’ve chosen the ones we feel sorry for the most."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the editing process, the scenes that are not very important for the story are deleted. But sometimes, the creators delete really good scenes that give more depth to&nbsp;the characters and explain the logic of&nbsp;their actions better.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have seen dozens of&nbsp;deleted scenes from famous movies and we’ve chosen the ones we&nbsp;feel sorry for the most.</p><p><h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part&nbsp;I</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62e/df2/a3abdb5489ae57bd5fe13db86c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> and the Deathly Hallows: Part I, Ron <a href=#>explains</a> why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not safe to&nbsp;say the name of&nbsp;the Dark Lord. The thing&nbsp;is, the name is&nbsp;cursed, so&nbsp;when it’s pronounced, it’s easy to&nbsp;find the enemies of&nbsp;Voldemort. A&nbsp;wizard says the name and the curse works right away, giving out their location. The special squad gets the information and moves to&nbsp;that location.</p><p><h2>The Hunger Games</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebf/e72/6c9140532c9e6815a1d3034198.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you remember 12-year-old Rue, from District&nbsp;11, that Katniss tries to&nbsp;save? If&nbsp;you didn’t read the novel, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;not very clear for you why Katniss was crying so&nbsp;hard after the girl died. But the <a href=#>extended</a> scenes explain her actions and emotions much better.</p><p>Katniss shares food with Rue because District 11&nbsp;didn’t have meat and the girl had never tried rabbit. Also, there were scenes of&nbsp;the girls <a href=#>chatting</a> about different girl stuff before going to&nbsp;sleep. In&nbsp;that scene, you can see Katniss start to&nbsp;care about Rue because she reminds her of&nbsp;her sister.</p><p><h2>Frozen&nbsp;II</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72b/7ab/69707b5772a17ce58886c3b1be.jpg><p>This animation has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;really cool parts that didn’t make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the final version. One of&nbsp;them <a href=#>shows</a> how the King and the Queen tried to&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;handle Elsa’s magical powers.</p><p>The sisters search the castle and find a&nbsp;secret chamber. They find books describing the possible sources of&nbsp;Elsa’s powers. This is&nbsp;how the girls find out that their mother was very serious about researching this matter. She read a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different myths showing the tragic lives of&nbsp;other creatures with similar powers. Maybe this is&nbsp;why the King and the Queen really wanted to&nbsp;contain their daughter’s powers. They were worried that the nature of&nbsp;her magic would cause trouble for her. By&nbsp;the way, it&nbsp;was her father’s idea to&nbsp;put gloves on&nbsp;little Elsa.</p><p><h2>Avengers: Endgame</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ab/1b8/0842c5512dabb1652a8093b7eb.jpg><p>The sacrifice Black Widow made is&nbsp;really sad. But initially, that scene was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;even more emotional. In&nbsp;the deleted scene, Black Widow and Hawkeye <a href=#>fight</a> Thanos’s warriors. During the fight, Natasha is&nbsp;shot several times and she crawls to&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the cliff to&nbsp;get the Soul Stone. Then, Natasha sees Thanos coming, so&nbsp;she decides to&nbsp;fall. Hawkeye is&nbsp;shocked. The friends didn’t even have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;say goodbye, unlike the scene we&nbsp;saw in&nbsp;the film. We&nbsp;think that the deleted scene would have made it&nbsp;harder for Hawkeye to&nbsp;accept the death of&nbsp;his friend.</p><p><h2>Thor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f9/d60/8e286c5ab69a3e7d86f2f88287.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the very beginning of&nbsp;the film, we&nbsp;see the crowning ceremony of&nbsp;Thor. But before the ceremony, a&nbsp;very moving conversation happens between Thor and Loki. This deleted scene <a href=#>shows</a> the true attitude of&nbsp;Loki toward his brother. He&nbsp;says that he&nbsp;can be&nbsp;very jealous, but he&nbsp;asks Thor to&nbsp;never doubt that he&nbsp;really loves him.</p><p><h2>How to&nbsp;Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c13/22b/9c5fdc5555bb146fd767ac0ca5.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you remember Astrid talking to&nbsp;Hiccup’s mother about the wedding? The girl says that she would marry Hiccup but she doesn’t want to&nbsp;get married just for the marriage. She wants it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;because of&nbsp;love. And then the conversation <a href=#>switches</a> to&nbsp;Hiccup’s mother. Astrid asks her how she decided to&nbsp;marry her late husband. Unfortunately, the creators didn’t keep this scene in&nbsp;the final version.</p><p><h2>The Devil Wears Prada</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65c/f2d/b6adaa59bea6ef0c85a30692e5.jpg><p>Miranda Priestly is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict boss. Her assistant Andrea had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things to&nbsp;get her to&nbsp;say something good. And Andrea succeeds but we&nbsp;don’t see this in&nbsp;the film. But, the deleted scene shows that.</p><p>Another deleted scene finally shows&nbsp;us Miranda’s husband. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;very rude and he&nbsp;makes his wife embarrassed for him. But Andrea helps Miranda and Miranda <a href=#>thanks</a> her for that.</p><p>The creators of&nbsp;the film probably thought that the scene wasn’t necessary, so&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;not show the soft and kind side of&nbsp;Miranda Priestly. By&nbsp;the way, the people that watched the theater version saw the deleted scene. Others weren’t that lucky.</p><p><h2>Kill Bill: Vol.&nbsp;2</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb8/ea0/bd5a0b55eeb7345b887bcb9f4f.jpg><p>For reasons we&nbsp;don’t know, director Quentin Tarantino didn’t include the <a href=#>scene</a> where we&nbsp;could see what a&nbsp;skillful fighter Bill is. This scene would’ve made it&nbsp;easier for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;understand how threatening this character&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>Titanic</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d9/c9f/fbc6875391b6fb839d5dcc40cc.jpg><p>The love story between Rose and Jack is&nbsp;obviously the most important plotline in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a>. But initially, James Cameron didn’t just focus on&nbsp;the tragic relationship of&nbsp;this couple. In&nbsp;the deleted scenes, we&nbsp;can see the story of&nbsp;Jack’s friend Fabrizio and Helga.</p><p>Helga and Fabrizio were shown as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple in&nbsp;the deleted scenes several times. Fabrizio <a href=#>met</a> her on&nbsp;the lower deck. Helga didn’t speak English, so&nbsp;she tried to&nbsp;talk about her herself with gestures. In&nbsp;the next scene, they <a href=#>dance</a> together.</p><p>But the most moving scene was the goodbye scene. When all of&nbsp;the 3rd class passengers were locked&nbsp;in, Helga and her parents were simply waiting for their turn. But Fabrizio knew they had to&nbsp;look for another way, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href=#>tried</a> to&nbsp;take the girl with him. But Helga couldn’t leave her family. This was the last time they kissed. And Fabrizio promised he&nbsp;would never forget her.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, in&nbsp;the final scene where Rose returns to&nbsp;the Titanic, you can see Helga and Fabrizio <a href=#>together</a> after death.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think that these scenes should have been kept in&nbsp;the films?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuv8KepZ6rXam1osCMsJyrnV2isrOvyKWcrKucrnqlscueq56cXZu%2FsLmMqKyrZZaWw7C%2ByK2cZqWfq7amv4xwcHJqYGd8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
