But when she leaves the clinic she’s treated as if she’s sick herself.
To avoid getting attacked, like some of her colleagues have, Vargas, 46, changes into civilian clothes when she leaves the hospital.
“If people see that you’re a nurse or that you work at a hospital, they look at you like you’re infected,” she told Bloomberg on Thursday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It happened to a head nurse at Vargas’s hospital, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">news reports</a> to a doctor in the state of Jalisco and a nurse in Sinaloa.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mexico isn’t the only country where doctors have been targeted by those who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fear they’re spreading the virus</a>. In India, health-care workers have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beaten by mobs</a> or forced out of apartment buildings. Assaults have been reported from Australia to the Philippines.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking </i><i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></i><i>.</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Monday, Fabiana Zepeda, the head nurse of Mexico’s national health system, known as IMSS, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pleaded with people</a> at a press conference to stop assaults against health workers. She said IMSS has recorded at least 21 attacks on staff in 12 states, but many more have been reported through social media.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We invite you, sincerely, to respect us,” she said with tears in her eyes. “We need the utmost solidarity in these times that call for all Mexicans to stick together,” she said in a presentation during the health ministry’s daily COVID-19 presentation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mexico has 12,872 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,221 deaths as of Saturday. Health authorities say the true number of patients may be eight times that amount.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Apart from aggression, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">health care workers</a> face a beleaguered hospital system that lacked equipment and staff even before the virus spread. Hospital staff in various cities, including Tijuana, have denounced shortages of protective gear and personnel. Vargas says her residents are buying their own surgical masks in Mexico City.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Coronavirus Pandemic May Be Causing an Anxiety Pandemic</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As of April 10, 329 doctors and nurses tested positive for the virus, Victor Hugo Borja, an IMSS official, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> local media. In Coahuila state alone, at least 100 were sick and five died as of April 15. Since then, the head of a hospital in the state succumbed to COVID-19.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said the country’s hospitals are prepared to deal with the crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We haven’t reached capacity yet,” he said on Wednesday, while acknowledging that medical equipment is needed to prepare for when the outbreak reaches its peak. Mexico is expecting to receive 2,500 ventilators from China and the U.S. during the months of April and May.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The government is also seeking to hire more medical staff and has implemented a bonus for those treating COVID-19 patients of about 20% of their salary. The National Guard began guarding the doors of IMSS hospitals on April 14th to protect workers and patients alike, Zepeda said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Vargas says Mexico needs to do more to protect hospital workers from attacks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s unnerving and sad,” she said. “People don’t understand that some of those health workers who could get hurt from an attack, means fewer workers to treat COVID-19 patients.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Please send any tips, leads, and stories to </i><i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">virus@time.com</a></i><i>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGJsgXqCjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
