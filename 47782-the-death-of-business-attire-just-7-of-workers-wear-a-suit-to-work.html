This is particularly common for female workers (43%) and those in middle class jobs (44%).</p><p data-block-key=6h6qo><i>What counts as smart casual attire, you ask? A recent YouGov survey showed</i> <a href=#><i>how Britons define it</i></a><i>.</i></p><p data-block-key=701ki>A quarter of workers (26%) say they wear “casual attire” at work, while one in five wear a work uniform provided by their employer (19%).

This is more common among men (13%) and among C2DE workers (22%).</p><p data-block-key=dc0m5>Unsurprisingly, those who work from home the whole time are more likely to dress casually than their counterparts who have to leave the house. Nevertheless, the suit remains firmly a thing of the past even for those who attend the workplace.</p><p data-block-key=dtf9g>Only 7% of those workers who never work from home wear a suit to work, as do 11% who work from home some of the time. (Our question asked people who worked from home some of the time to answer based on what they wore to the workplace, rather than what they wore at home).</p><p data-block-key=48im2>Those who never work from home split equally between wearing smart casual (30%) or a work uniform (31%). Most common among those who work from home some of the time is smart casual (49% - remember this applies to what they wear when they visit the office), while most of those who work from home the whole time wear casual attire (54%).</p><p data-block-key=9bmtt><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=afjtb><i>Photo: Getty</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZ2yFc3nToZxmnJWWwal5zp9km62jnrumv9JmmK2smaeybrbUrKtmb12ks27DzquinqqjYsSmrdFmmGarpZ7BbsDOZq6oqps%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
