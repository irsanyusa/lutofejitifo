And knowing how close the 41-year-old <i><a href=# title="Captain America" data-link=tag>Captain America</a></i> actor is&nbsp;to&nbsp;his mom, Lisa, makes&nbsp;us adore him even more. Moreover, what makes&nbsp;us get extra attached to&nbsp;this incredible mother and son duo is&nbsp;that they never shy away from sharing their stories with the world and love to&nbsp;tease each other with their distinctive humor.</p><p><h2>She encouraged his creative expression.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70f/bcb/4ff6775fdaa79020224dc4b054.jpg><p>Artistic talent runs in&nbsp;this <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, and thanks to&nbsp;his mom, the future Hollywood star, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his 3&nbsp;siblings, were encouraged to&nbsp;express themselves through art from a&nbsp;tender age. In&nbsp;fact, Chris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “My&nbsp;mother was a&nbsp;dancer for a&nbsp;long time. We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;tap floor in&nbsp;our basement.” He&nbsp;added, “And as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, we&nbsp;all grew up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;tap dancing.”</p><p>Plus, his passion for performing in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;an&nbsp;audience was ignited when he&nbsp;first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saw</a> his older sister, who had joined a&nbsp;theater company, sing and dance on&nbsp;stage. A&nbsp;few years later, all the other Evans siblings joined the theater company, and their mom Lisa even became the artistic director there.</p><p><h2>They are a&nbsp;bright duo.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23f/098/69596550e78bad7e8a9ad58133.jpg><p>Besides having inherited her artistic talent, Chris has also gotten his mom’s sharp sense of&nbsp;humor. And thanks to&nbsp;their fun-loving and mischievous personalities, it&nbsp;seems that there is&nbsp;never a&nbsp;dull moment in&nbsp;the Evans household. Both mother and son never shy away from speaking what’s on&nbsp;their mind and exposing each other, even publicly.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, one time, Lisa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> her son as ’’a big dork,’’ revealing that “at&nbsp;30, he&nbsp;still knows all the words to&nbsp;songs from <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.”</p><p>In&nbsp;his turn, the actor once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that his mama is&nbsp;a&nbsp;“nut,” adding that she was like “a&nbsp;character in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie.”</p><p>After all, Lisa loves to&nbsp;show her bright personality in&nbsp;the media. She once opened up&nbsp;about her thoughts on&nbsp;her kids, saying, “I&nbsp;thought they were the most beautiful things on&nbsp;the planet.” She was then quick to&nbsp;joke, “But really, they were just goofy looking, average. They all had crooked teeth and silly haircuts.”</p><p><h2>She gave him the best advice of&nbsp;his life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a71/e4c/68116c576099d5ab8cb06a8bf8.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;believe that someone could turn down the iconic role of&nbsp;Captain America, yet Chris was one step away from doing just that. In&nbsp;fact, Lisa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that her son was afraid that extreme fame would put his much-valued privacy in&nbsp;danger. She recalled, “His biggest fear was losing his anonymity.”<br>And, of&nbsp;course, when faced with such a&nbsp;life-changing choice, the actor called his mom for some much-needed advice.</p><p>And she recalled asking him, ’’Look, you want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;acting work for the rest of&nbsp;your life?’’ And then adding, ’’If you do&nbsp;this part, you will have the opportunity. You’ll never have to&nbsp;worry about paying the rent.’’ And this is&nbsp;how, thanks to&nbsp;his mom’s wise words, Chris was convinced to&nbsp;take the role, and consequently, he&nbsp;became one of&nbsp;Hollywood’s biggest stars.</p><p><h2>He’s an&nbsp;extra sensitive guy.</h2></p><p>Lisa believes that her famous son has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inherited</a> her “crying gene.” In&nbsp;fact, despite his tough guy superhero persona on&nbsp;the big screen, it&nbsp;seems that the <i>Captain America</i> actor has a&nbsp;big, soft heart and his tears are exceptionally abundant. Evans even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “I’m a&nbsp;sap.” He&nbsp;explained that he&nbsp;even cries at&nbsp;Kodak commercials and family movies.</p><p>And a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the reason why he’s so&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;his <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the fact that he&nbsp;comes from a&nbsp;big family. He&nbsp;explained, “I&nbsp;like family dramas. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big family. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very dramatic family. I&nbsp;understand the complexities of&nbsp;family struggle.”</p><p><h2>And she always has his back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66d/e31/50baf65e328a9970d7b7586fbb.jpg><p>It&nbsp;doesn’t matter one bit if&nbsp;her beloved Chris is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;full-grown adult and a&nbsp;big movie star because Lisa is&nbsp;always ready to&nbsp;defend her son whenever the media mentions him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way she doesn’t like.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, she can’t stand it&nbsp;when her 6-foot-tall boy is&nbsp;called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>short</a>. She revealed, “Somebody wrote on&nbsp;IMDb that he&nbsp;looked short!” The mama bear felt offended and had to&nbsp;explain, “He&nbsp;was standing next to&nbsp;Chris Hemsworth&nbsp;— of&nbsp;course he&nbsp;looked short!” And with her usual sense of&nbsp;humor, she added, “Shaquille O’Neal would look short!”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Chris’s close relationship with his mama? Do&nbsp;you think that he&nbsp;wouldn’t have been able to&nbsp;reach such a&nbsp;level of&nbsp;stardom without Lisa’s support?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ycn6uho2Kyt63NrGSesKSnrm6%2Fz56aopmcYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZZiewG65wKaYZqWRmbJutMimZK2glWKvqrOMrKuaql2dsm610marqJyRrnp5fJhqb25n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
