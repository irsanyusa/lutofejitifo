With winter officially in full swing, there’s no better time to invest in a high quality coat to keep you toasty without sacrificing style, whether you’re braving the ski slopes, hitting the city streets, or just looking for the perfect puffer to pair with everything, activewear included.</p><p>The best winter jackets and coats for women are warm, versatile, stylish, and suitable for the climate you’ll be sporting them in. You may even need multiple options for different purposes, like a heavyweight down jacket for frigid winter temps and a beautiful, warm wool coat for dressing up. We spoke with a few stylists and scoured the Internet to discover the greatest, top-rated, coziest and cool coats to slay the season.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-winter-jackets-and-coats-for-women>What to consider when buying winter jackets and coats for women</h2><p>Quality outerwear is definitely an investment, so before forking out hundreds (or thousands) of dollars on a beautiful, brand new winter jacket or coat, you’ll want to ask yourself the following questions:</p><h3>Where will you wear the coat?</h3><p>“When trying to decide which types of winter coats you’ll need, you’ll need to consider both the climate you live in (how cold, how wet, how much snow, etc.) and, just as importantly, what you’re planning to do in your winter coat,” says style expert Shana Draugelis, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Mom Edit</a>.</p><p>For short stints in the cold, like getting to and from your car, Draugelis recommends something cute, comfortable, and easy to take off and carry around when indoors. “But if you’re going to be standing at the playground for hours on end in the snow (or maybe even sleet), then a more technical, truly warm jacket is in order. I do think almost everyone can benefit from one stylish, fashion jacket for going out at night, though,” she says.</p><p>For extreme cold, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Stitch Fix</a> stylist Jessica Sockel says to opt for insulated parkas, while milder climates may only require a light jacket: “A breathable and waterproof option is great for outdoor activities, while a stylish wool coat is perfect for city dwelling.”</p><h3>How does it fit?</h3><p>As you consider the fit of a jacket or coat, you’ll want to account for what you plan on wearing underneath. Is there enough room in the arms (and under the arms) to layer the jacket over a chunky sweater, or will it only work with a thinner top? “Make sure you have enough room for layering, but not so much space that you look like the Michelin man,” advises celebrity style expert <a rel=nofollow href=#>Melissa Rivers</a>.</p><p>To stay simultaneously warm and stylish, Sockel swears by the “Three Layer Rule”. “It’s easy for anyone to replicate–it involves creating an outfit using three distinct layers that each serve a specific purpose to keep you comfortable and stylish,” she explains. “For example, start by wearing a light knit as your base layer, a cardigan over that, and finishing with a longline wool coat. This method is a great way to account for shifts in weather throughout the day and it ensures your look offers the perfect amount of variety and dimension.”</p><h3>Is it warm and functional?</h3><p>“When buying a winter coat, it’s important to consider factors such as insulation, material, and fit,” says Sockel. “Look for a coat with insulation made from down or synthetic materials to keep you warm during the cold season.” For those living in harsher climates, she suggests opting for materials that are both waterproof and windproof, “to protect you against the cold, along with anything else Mother Nature throws your way!” You’ll also want to think about technical details and features that matter to you, like a hood, well-placed pockets, and zippers.</p><h3>Do you love it?</h3><p>At the end of the day, any winter coat should suit your own personal style and functionality preferences, in addition to being comfortable to wear. Consider everything from color and length to the overall look of the jacket. Are you more of a neutrals, luxe minimalist kind of girl, or do you prefer something bold, sporty, and casual?</p><h3>What’s your budget?</h3><p>The best winter jackets and coats for women can range in cost from under $100 to several thousand. Determine your budget first, and then filter your search to include only options within that range. It can also be a good idea to wait for a great sale, or take advantage of first time purchase discounts at online retailers.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-winter-jackets-and-coats-for-women>Our top picks for the best winter jackets and coats for women</h2><h3>Best value winter coat for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Quince Featherless Quilted Puffer Jacket</a></h3><p>Quilted coats are everywhere right now, and we’re especially loving this classic, wallet-friendly option from Quince, which cuts out the middleman so you save money without sacrificing on quality. It’s extra warm without being bulky and features a water-repellent finish to help you stay dry(ish) during a slight drizzle. It comes in three neutral and super versatile colors (navy, chestnut, and black) and is made from 100% recycled materials. Shopping tip: If you’re looking to give your wardrobe a refresh, Quince is a great choice for value-priced classics. The brand made our lists for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best cashmere sweaters for women</a> (and for men), the <a rel=alternate href=#>best t-shirts for women</a>, and the <a rel=alternate href=#>best white button-down shirts for women</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS - XL</li><li>Colors: Navy, chestnut, black</li><li>Material: 100% recycled nylon</li><li>Price at time of publish: $79.90</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Excellent value</li><li>High low hem for extra warmth and ease of movement</li><li>Water-repellent</li><li>Classic and versatile color options</li><li>Made with recycled materials</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviewers don’t love the boxy fit</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A classic, quality puffer that won’t break the bank and is right on trend.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best value winter coat for women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.quince.com/3EM4kDhNiwXuxwaBwaF0LV/0310665e0b06a6133b7ab5b89f8e8945/W-JKT-41-NVY_1530.jpg alt="Quince Featherless Quilted Puffer Jacket" title="Quince Featherless Quilted Puffer Jacket" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Quince Featherless Quilted Puffer Jacket</h3></p><h3>Best waterproof winter jacket for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Barbour Campbell Showerproof Jacket</a></h3><p>A stylish waterproof jacket that doesn’t look so obviously waterproof? Consider us obsessed. “I love this option as a classic and high-quality choice for cooler temperatures,” says Sockel. A fleece lining provides extra warmth, and it looks equally as chic unzipped with a cute top or lightweight sweater underneath, as it does zipped up when it’s wet out. The olive color is especially wearable with most everything.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: 4 - 14</li><li>Colors: Olive</li><li>Material: 100% cotton</li><li>Price at time of publish: $270</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Waterproof</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Stylish</li><li>Fleece lining for warmth</li><li>Lightweight and packable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only available in one color</li><li>Slightly pricey</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This waterproof jacket is a classic choice for wet weather when it’s not too cold out.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best waterproof winter jacket for women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d3n78nkjl8tizo.cloudfront.net/stitch-fix/image/upload/q_auto alt="Barbour Campbell Showerproof Jacket" title="Barbour Campbell Showerproof Jacket" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Barbour Campbell Showerproof Jacket</h3></p><h3>Best puffer winter coat for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Alo Yoga Gold Rush Puffer</a></h3><p>Puffer jackets aren’t typically thought of as the most chic piece in one’s closet, but a cropped style, like this bestselling puffer from Alo Yoga, feels super updated and modern. “Not only does a cropped puffer look especially good with this season’s baggier jeans or sweatpants, but I’ve found that it works with dresses, too, giving them a less-precious vibe,” says Draugelis. Alo’s puffer is weather-resistant, with a cinchable hem for a more fitted and fashionable look, as well as to keep the warmth in. A tall collar helps protect from the elements too, and zippered pockets keep your essentials safely stowed.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS - L</li><li>Colors: Black, espresso, toasted almond, navy, cherry cola</li><li>Material: 100% nylon</li><li>Price at time of publish: $198</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Cool, cropped style</li><li>Cinchable hem</li><li>Weather-resistant</li><li>Warm</li><li>Tall collar</li><li>Zip pockets</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only goes up to size L</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This versatile, cropped puffer is warm with major cool girl vibes.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best puffer winter coat for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Alo Yoga Gold Rush Puffer</h3></p><h3>Best winter down coat for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The North Face Women’s Hydrenalite Down Hoodie</a></h3><p>With over 600 rave reviews, this versatile North Face down jacket is a must-buy. It’s available in a bunch of cool colors and many customers report how comfortable, chic, lightweight, and wearable it is, pairing well with everything from athleisure to workwear. It features an insulated three-piece hood to keep you warm on the coldest days and 600-fill recycled down baffles, as well as elasticized cuffs. We also like how packable it is if you’re only traveling with a carry-on, and the fact that it comes in extended sizing up to 2XL.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS - 2XL</li><li>Colors: Eight</li><li>Material: 100% recycled nylon taffeta with non-PFC durable water-repellent (non-PFC DWR) finish</li><li>Price at time of publish: $200</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Stylish</li><li>Lightweight and packable</li><li>Warm</li><li>Hooded</li><li>Lots of color options</li><li>Extended sizing</li><li>Versatile</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only water-repellent, not waterproof</li><li>Sells out fast in most popular colors/sizes</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This warm and stylish down jacket checks all the boxes and pairs with everything.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best winter down coat for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>The North Face Women’s Hydrenalite Down Hoodie</h3></p><h3>Best parka winter coat for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Canada Goose Rhoda Parka</a></h3><p>A premium parka is a smart investment piece for extreme cold, and nobody does it better than iconic outerwear brand Canada Goose. Available in a classic black and neutral limestone, the Rhoda is made with Lumina, a water-repellent and wind-resistant recycled fabric with a stunning and super-soft sheen finish. It’s incredibly warm and features a fixed wrap hood, oversized quilt-through design, and off-centered snap button closure. Rivers can personally attest to the quality of Canada Goose, noting that she has a Canada Goose down jacket, which “has been to hell and back and still looks great.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: 2XS - XL</li><li>Colors: Black, limestone</li><li>Material: Lumina crafted from 100% recycled nylon</li><li>Price at time of publish: $1,750</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Premium quality</li><li>Incredibly warm for extreme temps</li><li>Water-repellent and wind-resistant</li><li>Surprisingly lightweight</li><li>Very durable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Luxury pricing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This premium parka is worth the splurge if you live in extreme temperatures.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best parka winter coat for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Canada Goose Rhoda Parka</h3></p><h3>Best wool winter coat for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rails Lore Coat</a></h3><p>The wool coat is a timeless choice that’s sure to be a staple in your wardrobe, pairing well with everything from jeans, <a rel=alternate href=#>leggings</a>,<a rel=alternate href=#>T-shirts</a>, and dresses to tailored office attire. Jennifer Cassara, CEO and founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>GoodRobe & Co.</a> loves the versatility of the classic wool coat. “Depending on your style, you can choose from classic colors like black and camel or opt for one of the many fun options out there—my personal pick is the apple green version from Rails, because it adds just the perfect amount of pop,” she says. It’s warm, with an oversized fit, so you can easily layer it over chunky sweaters and turtlenecks. It’s also available in a beautiful, neutral ivory, fall plaid, and more playful prints and colors.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XXS - XL</li><li>Colors: Green apple, ivory, topaz, camel jet, nala</li><li>Material: 65% wool, 35% polyester</li><li>Price at time of publish: $458</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Several color and print options</li><li>Oversized fit for easy layering</li><li>Warm</li><li>Stylish</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An excellent, oversized wool-blend coat that comes in a variety of prints and colors to suit your style.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best wool winter coat for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Rails Lore Coat</h3></p><h3>Best sherpa jacket for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Alo Yoga Foxy Sherpa Jacket</a></h3><p>I own this bestselling sherpa jacket in camel and constantly get compliments every time I wear it. In fact, many of my best friends have purchased their own after seeing me in mine. During the winter, I pair it with basic black leggings or some of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best sweatpants for women</a> for morning dog walks, and I’ll also throw it on with cute boyfriend jeans and boots for a more casual date night when it’s freezing out. The plush sherpa is incredibly soft and cozy, and the hood is removable too, so you can completely change up your look based on the weather or what you’re doing.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS - L</li><li>Colors: Camel, ivory, black, espresso</li><li>Material: Plush sherpa, 100% polyester</li><li>Price at time of publish: $198</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Stylish</li><li>Very comfortable</li><li>Warm</li><li>Goes with everything</li><li>Removable hood</li><li>Cute, neutral color options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Sold out in some sizes</li><li>Only goes up to L</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This chic sherpa jacket looks great with workout wear or your fave date night ‘fit.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best sherpa jacket for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Alo Yoga Foxy Sherpa Jacket</h3></p><h3>Best ski jacket for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Halfdays Lawrence Jacke</a></h3><p>If you’re looking for a fashion-forward, eco-friendly, and insulated ski jacket that performs both on and off the slopes, look no further than Halfdays’ waterproof Lawrence Jacket. It’s available in a bunch of beautiful colors, including plenty of brights so you can easily be spotted on the mountain. No technical detail was spared in its construction, either: There’s a helmet-friendly adjustable hood, adjustable hem, powder skirt, comfortable high collar, convenient underarm vents so you’re never sweaty, two exterior hand pockets, a ski pass pocket with a goggle wipe, an interior beanie pocket, and an exterior chest pocket with an attached phone leash so you’re always connected (literally).</p><p>“This jacket checks every single box,” raves one reviewer. Another calls it “a wardrobe staple when the temperature drops, even when I'm not on the slopes!”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS - 2XL</li><li>Colors: 14</li><li>Material: 100% recycled polyester shell with primaloft eco 100% PCR insulation</li><li>Price at time of publish: $375</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Fashion-forward, flattering fit</li><li>Tons of fun color options</li><li>Inclusive size range</li><li>Eco-friendly</li><li>Plenty of pockets</li><li>Smart technical details, from an adjustable helmet-friendly hood to a phone leash and ski pass pocket with a goggle wipe</li><li>Waterproof and insulated</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This design-forward ski jacket performs beautifully on and off the slopes.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best ski jacket for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Halfdays Lawrence Jacket</h3></p><h3>Best stylish winter jacket: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Free People Quinn Quilted Jacket</a></h3><p>This beautiful, boxy, cropped quilted jacket is edgy, cool, and effortlessly chic all at once.

The water-resistant puffer is available in a rainbow of hues ranging from neon pink to emerald green (Time Stamped Shopping editor Brie Dyas’ pick) and even some patterns like camel leopard and marble. “It’s priced roughly the same as options you’d find at big box stores, but the construction is a lot better,” says Dyas, who tested out this coat. “It has a really warm fleece lining, storm cuffs that go over your thumb for better layering, a snap closure over the zipper to keep the cold out, and a hood, which has become weirdly optional for women’s coats these days.” Though it is a puffer, the princess seam details subtly add shaping, to reduce the marshmallow effect that puffy coats can sometimes give.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS - 6X</li><li>Colors: Black, burgundy, camel leopard, dark green, dusty blue, ivory, metallic taupe, navy, olive, sage green, tan, black/white marble, neon pink, poppy red</li><li>Materials: 100% polyester</li><li>Price at time of publish: $68</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Wide range of size and color availability</li><li>Very budget-friendly</li><li>Storm cuffs and snap closures help keep the chill away</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Princess seaming adds shape, but it can make the jacket fit a bit tighter in the bust</li><li>Not waterproof</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A bargain-priced basic in an impressive array of colors (and sizes) that’ll be your go-to all winter.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best winter coat for women from Amazon</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Amazon Essentials Women's Heavyweight Long-Sleeve Hooded Puffer Coat (Available in Plus Size), Dark Green, Medium</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-winter-jackets-and-coats-for-women>How we chose the best winter jackets and coats for women</h2><p>We spoke with four fashion and style experts to understand what to look for in the best winter jackets and coats for women, and featured a few of their expert recommendations. We also only included outerwear with plenty of positive reviews, as well as brands we personally own and love so we can vouch for the quality.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What are the different types of winter jackets?</h3><p>From parkas, peacoats, and puffers to wool, down, fleece, and faux fur, winter jackets come in all shapes, sizes, and styles to cater to everyone and every type of weather. “We see clients opting for parkas, which are heavy, insulated coats great for the extreme cold,” says Sockel. “There are ski jackets that are designed for winter sports and often feature waterproofing and insulation.”</p><p>Puffer jackets are perfect for her clients who want a more trend-forward look that’s still going to keep them warm, she adds, and if you’re looking for more flexibility and breathability, Sockel loves a softshell jacket. She’s also seeing a surge in popularity of wool coats and pea coats, “since they are so easy to dress up for a formal event or more casually paired over a workout set after the gym.”</p><h3>When should you wear a down jacket?</h3><p>According to Rivers, you can wear a down coat pretty much anywhere, as well as find them at almost any price point. Draugelis agrees, noting that down jackets are her most-worn winter coats. “They’re the best mix of warmth and comfort, and the new ones are incredibly lightweight,” she says. “I also appreciate the wide range of styles, too–everything from trendy cropped puffers (fun fact: these look amazing with dresses) to a maxi-length coat that feels like wearing a sleeping bag.” She’s worn her down jacket virtually everywhere, including running errands, going for walks, restaurants, and even to fancy parties. “It’s a really versatile piece, and cute, too!”</p><h3>What’s the difference between a down jacket’s fill power and fill weight?</h3><p>“Fill power tells you the quality of the down, and for truly warm parkas (or maxi puffers), this is where I like the fill power to be at least 600,” says Draugelis. Alternatively, fill weight just tells you how much down they used in the jacket overall. “In general, the higher the fill weight, the more insulated the jacket. That said, if the fill weight is higher, but the quality of down used was low (aka fill power), then the jacket may not be that warm.” She personally pays more attention to fill power.</p><h3>How should a winter jacket fit?</h3><p>Rivers says shoulder fit is one of the most important fits for a winter coat. “The seams should sit at the edge of your shoulders without hanging over or being too narrow,” she tells us. Sleeve length is also crucial: “Sleeves should be long enough to cover your wrists when your arms are relaxed, but they shouldn't be so long that they cover your hands. Also, make sure you’re not feeling restricted when you put your coat on, because you want to have the freedom to move and layer,” she notes. “Lastly, if there’s a hood, it should fit nicely around your head without obstructing your view. Picking a coat with an adjustable hood is even better!”</p><h3>How much does a winter jacket cost?</h3><p>Winter coats and jackets are available at a wide range of price points, so finding something in your budget shouldn’t be tough. “Depending on what you’re looking for, I’ve found some great faux-fur jackets for under $75, and some really warm parkas for over $1,000, although you certainly don’t have to spend that much,” says Draugelis. “In general, expect to spend around $200-$500 on a good winter coat.”</p><h3>How long should a winter jacket last?</h3><p>It all depends–the lifespan of a winter jacket can vary greatly based on usage, quality, and care, points out Sockel. “A well-maintained, high-quality jacket can last ten or more years, while lower-quality ones may last a few years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp567tbHRZqGam5uawbR5wKebZpuflsG0ecWoqWavn6Kyr3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
