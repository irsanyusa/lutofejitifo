Trollface</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/508/55b/097207512da4cd7ddec510703f.jpg><p>The Troll Face, also known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Trollface</a>, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most iconic meme faces there&nbsp;is! It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular meme featuring a&nbsp;character with a&nbsp;sly grin, often used to&nbsp;represent Internet trolls and their mischievous actions. It&nbsp;stands out as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the earliest and most recognizable faces in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;rage comics.</p><p>Created by&nbsp;Carlos Ramirez, a&nbsp;college student from Oakland, <strong>Trollface came to&nbsp;life on&nbsp;September&nbsp;19, 2008, through the simple tools of&nbsp;Microsoft Paint. Ramirez, just 18&nbsp;at the time, shared his creation on&nbsp;his DeviantArt page, “Whynne,” as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rage comic titled </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>Trolls</strong></i></a><strong>, exploring the seemingly pointless world of&nbsp;trolling.</strong></p><p>The image gained initial traction on&nbsp;the imageboard site <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4chan</a> after Ramirez posted it&nbsp;there. Users quickly embraced Trollface as&nbsp;the universal symbol of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Internet troll and a&nbsp;versatile character for rage comics. Its popularity skyrocketed, spreading beyond 4chan to&nbsp;platforms like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Urban Dictionary</a> in&nbsp;2009, eventually making its way to&nbsp;other image-sharing sites like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Imgur</a> and <a href=# title=Facebook data-link=tag>Facebook</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting turn of&nbsp;events in&nbsp;March 2021, Ramirez announced plans to&nbsp;sell a&nbsp;non-fungible token (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>NFT</a>) featuring Trollface, adding a&nbsp;modern twist to&nbsp;its legacy.</p><p><strong>Trollface’s significance in&nbsp;the Internet culture is&nbsp;evident, with La&nbsp;Tercera dubbing it&nbsp;“the father of&nbsp;memes.” The meme has even been commemorated with a&nbsp;bust displayed at&nbsp;the Museo del Meme in&nbsp;Mexico City, solidifying its place in&nbsp;the meme hall of&nbsp;fame.</strong></p><p><h2>2. Doge</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5c/d0a/99843c51509c4a7a933191ddcc.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Doge</strong></a><strong>, pronounced&nbsp;as [DOHJ], is&nbsp;a&nbsp;term commonly used as&nbsp;slang for “dog,” particularly associated with images of&nbsp;Shiba Inus, affectionately called “Shibes.”</strong> The central figure of&nbsp;this phenomenon is&nbsp;Kabosu, a&nbsp;Shiba Inu whose owner, Atsuko Sato, captured viral photos in&nbsp;the early months of&nbsp;2010. These images unleashed a&nbsp;wave of&nbsp;Internet memes and set the stage for broader trends in&nbsp;the years that followed.</p><p>The hallmark of&nbsp;the Doge meme is&nbsp;a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Shiba Inu, often Kabosu, accompanied by&nbsp;colorful text in&nbsp;the Comic Sans font in&nbsp;the foreground. <strong>This text represents an&nbsp;internal monologue intentionally written in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;broken English</strong>. While Kabosu is&nbsp;the most frequently featured Shiba Inu, variations with other Shiba Inus have also gained popularity.</p><p>The genesis of&nbsp;the Doge phenomenon can be&nbsp;traced back to&nbsp;February&nbsp;13, 2010, when <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Atsuko Sato</a>, a&nbsp;Japanese kindergarten teacher, shared several photos of&nbsp;her adopted Shiba Inu, Kabosu, on&nbsp;her personal blog. One particular snapshot of&nbsp;Kabosu sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;couch, casting a&nbsp;sidelong glare with raised eyebrows, became an&nbsp;iconic representation of&nbsp;the meme.</p><p>Interest in&nbsp;the Doge meme surged online around July 2013. Furthermore, December 2013 marked the introduction of&nbsp;Dogecoin, a&nbsp;novel cryptocurrency and the first of&nbsp;its kind.</p><p>The term “Doge” made its way into Dictionary.com in&nbsp;November 2015, expanding its definition beyond the image macro and its variations to&nbsp;encompass the unique form of&nbsp;“language” it&nbsp;employs. <strong>Media publications recognized Doge as&nbsp;a&nbsp;defining meme of&nbsp;Internet culture in&nbsp;the 2010s, attributing its influence to&nbsp;subsequent online developments like DoggoLingo and WeRateDogs.</strong> The impact of&nbsp;Doge extended beyond its initial meme status, leaving an&nbsp;indelible mark on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=evolving data-link=tag>evolving</a> landscape of&nbsp;Internet expression and humor.</p><p><h2>3. Derp face</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a90/228/621eb95245b473d857cc01f3b8.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Derp</strong></a><strong>, often associated with a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;foolishness, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;expression akin to&nbsp;earlier interjections like “duh” and “dur.”</strong> In&nbsp;image macros, the individual is&nbsp;typically depicted with eyes looking in&nbsp;opposite directions, accompanied by&nbsp;the caption “DERP.”</p><p>The origin of&nbsp;the term “derp” can be&nbsp;traced back to&nbsp;the 1998 comedy film Baseketball, created by&nbsp;Trey Parker and Matt Stone of&nbsp;South Park fame. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;memorable scene involving the inappropriate smell of&nbsp;underwear, Matt exclaims “Derp” as&nbsp;he&nbsp;hastily exits.</p><p>On&nbsp;the Internet hub 4chan, the influence of&nbsp;“derp” burgeoned through the use of&nbsp;captioned image macros. Over time, it&nbsp;transformed into a&nbsp;versatile placeholder in&nbsp;textual form.<strong> Initially, the concept was simple—a fitting image paired with the caption “derp.” However, it&nbsp;quickly evolved into clever wordplays, incorporating the names of&nbsp;celebrities depicted in&nbsp;the macros.</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;the realm of&nbsp;rage comics, “herp” and “derp” find common usage as&nbsp;placeholders for names or&nbsp;topics that are non-essential to&nbsp;the story or&nbsp;joke. A&nbsp;rage character named Herp Derp serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;representation of&nbsp;stupidity or&nbsp;ignorance.</p><p><strong>The evolution of&nbsp;“derp” reflects its adaptability and resonance in&nbsp;Internet culture, becoming more than just an&nbsp;expression of&nbsp;foolishness.</strong> It&nbsp;has evolved into a&nbsp;versatile tool for humor and commentary, contributing to&nbsp;the ever-changing landscape of&nbsp;online expression and memes. <strong>The playful and adaptable nature of&nbsp;“derp” ensures its continued presence in&nbsp;the digital lexicon, embodying a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;Internet language that transcends its simple origins.</strong></p><p><h2>4. “Y&nbsp;U&nbsp;NO” guy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/57d/ea8/00908c5fe086c28f24cf75b9d4.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>The “Y&nbsp;U&nbsp;NO” Guy</strong></a><strong>, known for its use of&nbsp;SMS shorthands and casual grammar, has become an&nbsp;image macro series that playfully directs attention to&nbsp;specific subjects or&nbsp;issues. </strong>The stick-figure character wears a&nbsp;distinctive facial expression believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;the Japanese sci-fi manga and anime series Gantz.</p><p>The inception of&nbsp;the “Y&nbsp;U&nbsp;NO” phrasal template occurred on&nbsp;LOLTumblrWallpapers, where it&nbsp;was first posted and gained significant traction with over 10,000 reblogs and likes on&nbsp;Tumblr. In&nbsp;this initial instance, the image macro featured a&nbsp;beige/light brownish background, showcasing the Gantz character at&nbsp;the center, with the caption, “I&nbsp;TXT U, Y&nbsp;U&nbsp;NO&nbsp;TXT BAK!?”</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;weeks, the macro series proliferated on&nbsp;platforms like Tumblr and Meme Generator, accumulating a&nbsp;substantial collection, both in&nbsp;image and text form without the distinct facial expression. The trend extended its reach to&nbsp;platforms like FunnyJunk and various culture-related blogs.</p><p><strong>The charm of&nbsp;“Y&nbsp;U&nbsp;NO” lies in&nbsp;its simplicity, using relatable language and a&nbsp;humorous tone to&nbsp;address everyday situations. The stick-figure’s expressive face, borrowed from the Gantz series, adds a&nbsp;playful touch to&nbsp;the meme’s overall appeal.</strong></p><p>The collaborative nature of&nbsp;online communities has played a&nbsp;significant role in&nbsp;the meme’s dissemination, with users contributing their own variations and adaptations. This collaborative spirit has fueled the meme’s popularity, ensuring its presence across diverse platforms and cultural blogs.</p><p><strong>The “Y&nbsp;U&nbsp;NO” Guy has found its place in&nbsp;the ever-evolving landscape of&nbsp;Internet humor, serving as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighthearted and relatable way for users to&nbsp;express frustrations or&nbsp;observations in&nbsp;a&nbsp;language that resonates with the casual and informal nature of&nbsp;online communication.</strong></p><p><h2>5. Rage Guy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f3/703/bad7055552984e74f5356aab9a.jpg><p>Another extremely well-known character of&nbsp;the meme faces—<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rageguy</a>, the central character of&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;simple and roughly drawn comics, is&nbsp;well-known for expressing rage and exasperation. <strong>These comics typically consist of&nbsp;four panes, showcasing situations that can trigger intense frustration, with the main character passionately screaming in&nbsp;anger. Over time, this character has evolved, giving rise to&nbsp;a&nbsp;broader comic series known as&nbsp;Rage Comics.</strong></p><p>The origins of&nbsp;Rageguy can be&nbsp;traced back to&nbsp;2008&nbsp;on the 4chan /b/&nbsp;imageboard. The first depiction was a&nbsp;basic 4-pane comic created using MS&nbsp;Paint, illustrating the common experience of&nbsp;“toilet splashback.” The initial three panes detailed the incident, and in&nbsp;the fourth pane, Rageguy made his debut, screaming in&nbsp;frustration, accompanied by&nbsp;the caption in&nbsp;bold red letters on&nbsp;the right side of&nbsp;his face.</p><p>The simplicity and versatility of&nbsp;Rageguy contributed to&nbsp;its popularity, leading to&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;an&nbsp;entire comic series known as&nbsp;Rage Comics. These comics often serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;humorous way for individuals to&nbsp;vent about relatable everyday frustrations.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;December 2010, the technology blog Mashable hosted a&nbsp;contest to&nbsp;determine the best Internet meme of&nbsp;the year. Rageguy earned a&nbsp;spot on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;“5&nbsp;Internet Meme Finalists,” standing alongside other notable memes like </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Sad Keanu</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Double Rainbow</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Bed Intruder</strong></a><strong> (the eventual winner).</strong></p><p>Rage Comics have become a&nbsp;staple in&nbsp;Internet culture, providing a&nbsp;platform for users to&nbsp;share their comical and rage-filled experiences in&nbsp;a&nbsp;visually engaging format. The adaptability and relatability of&nbsp;Rageguy continue to&nbsp;resonate with online communities, ensuring its enduring presence in&nbsp;the ever-evolving world of&nbsp;Internet humor.</p><p><h2>6. Me&nbsp;Gusta</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/200/c55/ce02b0511baca4c409abc4ed17.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Me&nbsp;Gusta</a>, a&nbsp;face from the world of&nbsp;Rage Comics, is&nbsp;commonly used to&nbsp;express approval in&nbsp;awkward or&nbsp;unconventional situations. The phrase “me&nbsp;gusta” translates to&nbsp;“I&nbsp;like&nbsp;it” in&nbsp;Spanish. <strong>Initially, it&nbsp;conveyed a&nbsp;peculiar sense of&nbsp;pleasure in&nbsp;sexually suggestive contexts, but over time, its meaning expanded to&nbsp;encompass a&nbsp;broader range, describing a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;being simultaneously disturbed and pleased.</strong></p><p>The adoption of&nbsp;the colloquial Spanish phrase “me&nbsp;gusta” into a&nbsp;Rage Comic drawing occurred when illustrator May Oswald (formerly known as&nbsp;Matt) shared her artwork on&nbsp;4chan and Reddit on&nbsp;March 18th, 2010. Her creation marked the birth of&nbsp;the Me&nbsp;Gusta meme within the online community.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview conducted on&nbsp;May 6th, 2021, Oswald disclosed that the original post on&nbsp;4chan was a&nbsp;strategic effort to&nbsp;propel the meme to&nbsp;go&nbsp;viral. She achieved this by&nbsp;sharing examples of&nbsp;the Me&nbsp;Gusta face in&nbsp;various memes from different accounts and&nbsp;IP addresses.</p><p>“Here was the plan. Oftentimes, when a&nbsp;new Rage Face was coming out in&nbsp;4chan at&nbsp;that time, how the thread would happen is&nbsp;that there would just be&nbsp;the face, and then with the colorful language of&nbsp;4chan, there would be&nbsp;the equivalent&nbsp;of, ‘Hey, new Rage Face just dropped. See what you guys can make of&nbsp;it.’ So&nbsp;my&nbsp;intention was to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the exact same thing, ‘Hey, new Rage Face just dropped.’ Post the image. But what&nbsp;I came in&nbsp;with was that&nbsp;I had made about two or&nbsp;three example comics to&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;get it&nbsp;out there with sort of&nbsp;what&nbsp;I was intending this face to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used for,” she explained.</p><p>Me&nbsp;Gusta’s popularity stems from its ability to&nbsp;encapsulate the mixed emotions people experience in&nbsp;peculiar situations. The face, with its distinctive expression, has become a&nbsp;widely recognizable symbol of&nbsp;both discomfort and approval in&nbsp;the realm of&nbsp;Internet humor.</p><p>Oswald’s intentional efforts to&nbsp;make the Me&nbsp;Gusta meme go&nbsp;viral highlight the collaborative and participatory nature of&nbsp;Internet culture. <strong>This meme’s journey from a&nbsp;carefully constructed post on&nbsp;4chan to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;ubiquitous symbol of&nbsp;mixed feelings showcases the dynamic evolution of&nbsp;online expressions. Me&nbsp;Gusta continues to&nbsp;resonate with users, serving as&nbsp;a&nbsp;versatile and relatable way to&nbsp;convey complex emotions in&nbsp;a&nbsp;humorous and concise manner.</strong></p><p><h2>7.

The first known instance was posted on&nbsp;May 28th, 2010, by&nbsp;FunnyJunk user Azuul in&nbsp;a&nbsp;thread titled “April Fools.” While the original artist remains unconfirmed, various sources point to&nbsp;Dominic Vanner as&nbsp;the illustrator behind the character, as&nbsp;noted by&nbsp;Dictionary.com.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;early June 2010, another instance featuring a&nbsp;bachelor salaryman surfaced on&nbsp;4chan. On&nbsp;August 5th, 2010, a&nbsp;Forever Alone rage comic gained popularity on&nbsp;Reddit, receiving over 275 upvotes and 70&nbsp;comments.</strong></p><p>The meme’s prevalence expanded rapidly, with over 23,000 image results on&nbsp;FunnyJunk and 50,000&nbsp;on Tumblr by&nbsp;September 2010. Recognizing its growing influence, the Forever Alone Comics blog was launched on&nbsp;September 11th to&nbsp;curate the increasing collection of&nbsp;four-pane comics. Around the same time, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>/r/foreveralone</a> subreddit was established, garnering over 25,300 subscribers in&nbsp;the subsequent three years. Early October witnessed mentions of&nbsp;Forever Alone in&nbsp;various blogs, including Geekosystem, Memebase, and Uproxx.</p><p>As&nbsp;the term “Forever Alone” evolved, it&nbsp;transcended its rage comic roots, becoming a&nbsp;broader statement about solitude. By&nbsp;February 13th, 2013, the International Business Times published a&nbsp;slideshow featuring notable Valentine’s Day Forever Alone comics and image macros. Reflecting its enduring popularity, a&nbsp;Facebook page titled “Forever Alone” amassed over 7.2 million submissions by&nbsp;February 2013.</p><p><strong>Forever Alone’s journey from a&nbsp;niche rage comic character to&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol resonating with a&nbsp;broader audience reflects the dynamic nature of&nbsp;Internet culture and the adaptability of&nbsp;online expressions in&nbsp;conveying complex emotions and experiences.</strong></p><p>Which of&nbsp;the meme faces was your favorite?
