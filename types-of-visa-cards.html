The difference is meaningful because each tier unlocks benefits of varying quality. For example, a Visa Infinite credit card may unlock top-tier travel insurance and fancy airport lounge access, while a traditional Visa credit card doesn’t.
But get this: Just because your credit card is capable of offering a suite of benefits doesn’t mean it will."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Below the VISA logo, you’ll see the word “Signature,” “Infinite,” or nothing at all.</p><p>The difference is meaningful because each tier unlocks benefits of varying quality. For example, a Visa Infinite credit card may unlock top-tier travel insurance and fancy airport lounge access, while a traditional Visa credit card doesn’t.</p><p>But get this: Just because your credit card is capable of offering a suite of benefits doesn’t mean it will. Your credit card issuer can opt out of particular benefits if it doesn’t want to include that privilege. The type of Visa credit card you have doesn’t automatically indicate a card’s actual perks.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what you can expect from all three types of Visa credit cards and view some examples of each.</p><h2 id=traditional-visa-benefits>Traditional Visa benefits</h2><p>If you’ve got a credit card that simply says “Visa” on the bottom, you’ve got a traditional Visa card. This is the lowest-tier Visa, but it’s far from insignificant. Here’s what you’ll get.</p><h3>Discounts and memberships</h3><ul><li>Shipt membership. Shipt provides same-day delivery from nearby grocery stores in as soon as one hour. When you enroll your Visa credit card, you’ll get one free month of Shipt membership, followed by three months of membership at half off. You’ll receive free delivery on orders totaling $35 or more.</li><li>Sofar Sounds access. Sofar Sounds gives you entry into intimate music, comedy, and dance shows. You’ll receive one free ticket (limit two per year) when purchasing one or more tickets. You’ll also get exclusive access to a seven-day advance presale.</li><li>Visa Offers. Get discounts and statement credits for purchases you’d make anyway. Visa Offers are always changing, but you can often find things such as 10% off Overstock.com, $200 off your first five boxes at Green Chef meal kit services, and more.</li></ul><h3>Emergency assistance</h3><ul><li>Roadside Dispatch. You can request help in the form of tire changing, jump starting, lockout service, fuel delivery, standard towing (up to five miles included), and more. You’ll need to pay for most services, but it’s nice to have.</li><li>Emergency cash disbursement. Receive a wire cash transfer to a nearby <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Western Union</a> within two hours.</li><li>Emergency card replacement. Receive a new credit card within 24 to 72 hours, depending on where you are.</li></ul><h3>Account management and protection</h3><ul><li>Dovly Uplift. Quickly and easily fix and manage your credit online. You can correct mistakes on your credit report and potentially boost your credit score.</li><li>Visa Zero Liability. You’re not responsible for fraudulent purchases on your credit card.</li><li>Lost/stolen card reporting. Call Visa for assistance with replacing your credit card and notifying vendors who use it.</li><li>ID Navigator. Norton ID Navigator can help you to know when your identity is in danger. It surveys the Dark Web and gives you credit-monitoring alerts.</li></ul><h2 id=examples-of-traditional-visa-credit-cards>Examples of traditional Visa credit cards</h2><h3><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span></h3><h3 class=product-title>Chase Freedom Unlimited®</h3><p>Credit score</p><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*credit_score_needed*,*api*:*cc*}>credit_score_needed</span></span></p><p>Intro APR</p><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*intro_apr_rate,intro_apr_duration*,*api*:*cc*}>intro_apr_rate,intro_apr_duration</span></span></p><p>Balance transfer intro apr</p><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*balance_transfer_intro_apr,balance_transfer_intro_duration*,*api*:*cc*}>balance_transfer_intro_apr,balance_transfer_intro_duration</span></span></p><p>APR</p><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*reg_apr,reg_apr_type*,*api*:*cc*}>reg_apr,reg_apr_type</span></span></p><p>Annual fees</p><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*annual_fees*,*api*:*cc*}>annual_fees</span></span></p><p>Welcome offer</p><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*bonus_miles_full*,*api*:*cc*}>bonus_miles_full</span></span></p><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Why we like it</h3></p><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> is a solid flat-rate earnings card with <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*annual_fee_disclaimer*,*api*:*cc*}>annual_fee_disclaimer</span></span> annual fee.

This card currently offers an additional 1.5% back on top of your regular earnings (on up to $20,000 in spending) during your first account year. That’s an excellent intro bonus, considering that the card already earns:</p><ul><li>5% back on travel reserved through the Chase Travel Portal.</li><li>3% back on dining and at drugstores.</li><li>1.5% back on all other eligible purchases.</li></ul><p>This is one of the best credit cards you can use for everyday spending, thanks to its respectable return on all purchases.

Visa doesn’t itself issue credit cards; it only processes the payments you make between your issuing bank and the merchant from which you’re buying.</p><h3>How to qualify for a Visa credit card</h3><p>You qualify for a Visa credit card exactly as you would with Mastercard, American Express, etc. If a bank that issues Visa credit cards considers you a good candidate for a card, it will extend credit to you. Work on <a rel=alternate href=#>building a respectable credit history</a> and a credit score of at least 700 before applying for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best Visa credit cards</a>.</p><h3>Which are the best 0% APR credit cards?</h3><p>It depends on your goals. If your primary goal is a large no-interest window, the Chase Slate Edge℠ offers a 0% intro APR with purchases and balance transfers for 18 months from opening your account (then 20.24% to 28.99% variable). However, if you’re willing to settle for a smaller intro APR window, the Chase Freedom Unlimited offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months (then 20.24% to 28.99% variable).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8tcXPnqpmp5Ziw6q%2FwGaamqqUqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
