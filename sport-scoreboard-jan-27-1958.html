¶ It took the Dodgers’ President Walter O’Malley five consecutive days of negotiation and four considerably different “final offers” before he managed to rent a Los Angeles home for his footloose ball club. The site: the monstrous (101,528 seats) L.A. Coliseum. The price, to be paid to the city and county of Los Angeles and to the state of California: $200,000 a year for 1958 and 1959, plus 10% of the gate, and all concession profits for the first nine games of each season following an opening series with the San Francisco Giants."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He finished the 440-yd. grind in 4:25.9, which was a 400-meter record as well. He sprinted 220 yds. in 2:04.8, setting a new 200-meter mark in the process.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">¶Sticking to the same old style—loafing off the pace until the last lap and then spurting to the tape—Villanova’s Irish Olympian Ron Delany stuck to the same old habit of winning mile races. Ron opened the 1958 track season at the Massachusetts K. of C. Games by coming home six yards in front of Chicago’s Phil Coleman in a Games record 4:05.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">¶Navy’s Football Coach Eddie Erdelatz played fast and loose with his new five-year contract just long enough to scout the football factory out at Texas A. & M. Like half a dozen others before him, including Michigan State’s Duffy Daugherty and former Notre Dame Coach Frank Leahy. Eddie looked over the high-priced proposition and decided to leave.
